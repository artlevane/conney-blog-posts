<h2 class="intro">OSHA 10- and 30-HOUR outreach training</h2>
<br>

Conney Safety's experienced safety professionals are authorized through OSHA Training Institute
<br>
Educations Centers to provide training in both Construction and General Industry. These voluntary training programs were developed to provide an overview of the hazards that employees may face in the workplace. Emphasis is placed on hazard identification, avoidance and control/prevention. 10-hour courses are geared toward entry-level employees while 30-hour courses are intended to provide those with responsibility over safety with more in-depth knowledge on OSHA and risk mitigation strategies.
<br>
Trainings can be customized to your facility, although much of the training as well as the timeframe is predetermined by OSHA. Upon completion of each course, students will receive an OSHA Training Institute Education Center wallet card.
