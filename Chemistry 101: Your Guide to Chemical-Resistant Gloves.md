<h2 class="intro">The key to selecting chemical-resistant gloves is determining the work application and the exact chemicals involved.</h2>
<br>
Chemical-resistant gloves help provide protection from a wide range of chemicals and minor hand injuries. The key to selecting chemical-resistant gloves is determining the work application and the exact chemicals involved.
<br><br>
Chemical-resistant gloves are typically made of nitrile, neoprene, PVC, butyl or latex rubber. Let's take a look at the benefits and common uses of each of these materials.
<br><br>
<h3>Types of Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h3>
<br>
Let’s discuss each of the different types of chemical-resistant gloves and their common uses. For a complete guide to all glove types, feel free to check out our <a href="https://www.conney.com/websphere/blog/posts/correct-hand-protection-complete-glove-selection-guide.html?utm_medium=chemical-resistant-gloves&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney">complete glove guide article here</a>.
<br><br>
<h4>Nitrile Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h4>
<br><span></span>
<ul>
  <li>Effective against oils, greases, acids, caustics, and many solvents</li>
  <li>Stronger resistance to punctures compared to latex and PVC</li>
  <li>Good resistance to abrasion and chemicals, making it suitable for prolonged use</li>
  <li>Suitable for individuals with latex allergies</li>
  <li>Common Uses: Laboratories, automotive industry and handling petrochemicals</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Neoprene Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Resistant to a wide range of acids, alkalis, and alcohols</li>
  <li>Offer good dexterity and flexibility, even in low temperatures</li>
  <li>Provides some resistance to heat and flames</li>
  <li>Common Uses: Handling of acids, caustics, and some solvents; food processing</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Generally more affordable compared to other chemical-resistant materials</li>
  <li>Good resistance to water-based chemicals, including acids, bases, and some solvents.</li>
  <li>Resistant to abrasion, cuts and punctures.</li>
  <li>Common Uses: Handling of acids, oils, greases and various chemicals in industrial environments</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Butyl Rubber Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Particularly effective against gasses, esters, ketones and other highly corrosive chemicals</li>
  <li>Offer excellent protection against gas and vapor penetration</li>
  <li>Maintains flexibility at low temperatures</li>
  <li>Common Uses: Handling of hazardous gasses, esters, ketones and chemical agents</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Latex Rubber Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Offer excellent dexterity and comfort, making it ideal for tasks requiring precision</li>
  <li>Highly flexible and provides a snug fit</li>
  <li>Good resistance to water-based chemicals and biological hazards, but limited against oils and organic solvents</li>
  <li>Will cause allergic reaction in individuals with latex allergies</li>
  <li>Common Uses: Medical environments, laboratories, and food processing</li>

<h2>What are the differences between supported and unsupported chemical-resistant gloves?</h2>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unsupported chemical-resistant gloves</strong> are constructed of the same material throughout, without a supporting cloth liner. Unsupported gloves are used in chemical-resistant applications where tactile sensitivity and dexterity are required. If good dexterity is critical, it is wise to choose unsupported gloves. Our unsupported gloves have a mil thickness listed so you can choose the proper glove based on the application and required durability.</li>
  <li><strong>Supported chemical-resistant gloves</strong> feature a chemical-resistant outer shell and an inner liner (such as cotton). Supported gloves are often used for heavy-duty work where finger dexterity is not a key requirement. The supporting liner enhances strength (cut, puncture and abrasion resistance), comfort and durability. This type of glove is also a sensible choice for heat or cold handling applications. Supported gloves never have a thickness listed because of the variances in liner thickness and the dipping process.</li>
