Use spill containment pallets to safely store and contain hazardous materials, chemicals or liquids to prevent spills and leaks. If a spill occurs, spill containment pallets have a built-in secondary containment basin or sump that can hold spilled or leaked liquids. Using these pallets can minimize the risk of costly cleanup efforts, regulatory fines and environmental damage caused by spills and leaks.
