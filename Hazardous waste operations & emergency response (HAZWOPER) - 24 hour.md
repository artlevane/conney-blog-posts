<h2 class="intro">Hazardous waste operations &amp; emergency response (HAZWOPER) - 24 hour</h2>
<br>

Hazardous waste facilities and cleanup sites aren't the only operations subject to OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. Companies that generate hazardous waste through the normal course of business and are NOT a treatment/storage/ disposable facility (TSDF)&endash;or have the potential for accidental release of hazardous substances&endash;are covered under this regulation.

This 24-hour training is designed to meet the requirements for a Hazmat Technician, which is defined under the standard as "anyone who responds aggressively to stop the release of hazardous substances." All HAZWOPER courses are taught by a qualified safety professional, and will include the following topics:
<br>
History of HAZWOPER Regulations

Site Characterization

Hazard Identification

Personal Protective Equipment Selection and Use

Air Sampling Methods

Emergency Response

Decontamination Procedures

Lockout/Tag Out

Excavations
