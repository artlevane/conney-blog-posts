<h2 class="intro">ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2021, American National Standard for Minimum Requirements for Workplace First Aid Kits and Supplies has been revised.</h2>
<br>
<h2>ANSI First Aid Kits: New 2021 Standard [Effective 10/15/22]</h2>
<br><br>
ANSI/ISEA Z308.1-2021 is the sixth revision of a voluntary industry standard that was first published in 1978 and builds upon the initial objective to standardize first aid kits. These standards ensure that items needed to treat the most common types of injuries and sudden illnesses encountered in the workplace are readily accessible and available.
<br><br>
<h2>ANSI First Aid Kits Updates</h2>
This new standard for ANSI first aid kits includes several notable updates:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>A foil blanket is now mandatory. This change reflects similar international standards and recognizes the multiple purposes that a blanket can serve. It can be used to treat hypothermia, act as a windbreaker or be worn as an emergency waterproof wrap.</li>
    <li>More specificity for tourniquets. The revised standard helps to distinguish tourniquets from those types of bands used to draw blood, which are not as effective in preventing blood loss, as is intended.</li>
    <li>Greater guidance regarding bleeding control kits. The update provides additional details on designated bleeding control kits, which contain more advanced first aid supplies to immediately treat life-threatening external bleeding.</li>
    <li>Greater emphasis on workplace hazard assessments. Included in the updated standard is a more robust discussion to assist the employer in assessing risks, identifying potential hazards, and selecting additional first aid supplies relevant to a particular application or work environment.</li>
</ul>
<br>
ANSI ISEA Z308.1 - 2021 retains the same kit classification system (Class A or Class B) first established in 2015 stating that ANSI <a href="https://www.grainger.com/category/safety/first-aid-and-wound-care/general-first-aid-kits?cm_sp=CM-Shop-_-inline-text-_-kh-class-a-class-b-first-aid-kits-_-2021-01">first aid</a> kits are classified based on both their assortment and quantity of <a href="https://www.grainger.com/category/safety/first-aid-and-wound-care">first aid supplies</a>.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Class A kits are designed to deal with the most common types of <a href="https://safety.grainger.com/insights/data-visualized/workplace-injury-statistics-and-incident-rates?utm_medium=ansi-first-aid-kits&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=WP_Injuries">workplace injuries</a>. Based on the new 2021 standard, class A kits must now include:
        <ul>
            <li>4 Additional Hand Sanitizers</li>
            <li>1 Foil Blanket, 52" X 84"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Class B first aid kits are designed with a broader range and quantity of supplies to deal with injuries in more complex or high-risk environments. Based on the new 2021 standard, class B kits must now include:
        <ul>
            <li>4 Additional Hand Sanitizers</li>
            <li>1 Foil Blanket, 52" X 84"</li>
            <li>1 Tourniquet</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
This voluntary standard goes into effect on October 15, 2022. Take a few moments to review the contents of your ANSI first aid kit now to ensure compliance.

"Employers should begin to check their first aid cabinets against the new standard, and make the recommended changes," said Todd VanHouten, Director of Product Development & Innovation at Cintas First Aid & Safety, and Chair of the ISEA First Aid Product Group. 
<br><br>
VanHouten also said, "While compliance with the standard is recommended, updating first aid stations, kits and protocols goes beyond compliance. The discussions and recommendations in this standard can help guide an organization's overall first aid program, ultimately helping to provide proper and timely treatment for all employees."
<br><br>
Developed by the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA), this standard was processed and approved using consensus procedures prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
