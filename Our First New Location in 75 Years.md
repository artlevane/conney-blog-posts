<h2 class="intro">Our First New Location in 75 Years</h2>
<br>
We are excited to promote our first new Conney branch in 75 years. Here to tell us more about this new location in Chicago is our Outside Sales rep Meghan O'Connell:
<br><br>
<em>Hello everyone, I'm Meghan, the Outside Sales Rep based out of our new location in Woodridge Illinois, serving the Chicago market. I've been in Chicago for all my life and for 15 years, I've been serving the safety and MRO space. I'm excited to hit the ground running and help new and existing customers!
<br><br>
Chicago is close enough to our headquarters in Madison to get full support from Conney, but it was an area that we needed to give more attention. The Chicago market has so much potential, but there definitely needs to be feet on the street to really understand the pain points of our customers and offer them the best end-to-end solutions.
<br><br>
Overall, this expansion has been great for the Chicago area. I couldn't be happier to support our customers face-to-face and build those relationships as a trusted safety advisor.
<br><br>
We look forward to having a grand opening once it's safe to do so â€“ stay tuned!</em>
