These tests verify the integrity of the gloves so that the electrical safety of the person wearing them is ensured, and that the product meets or exceeds ASTM standards and OSHA regulations.
<br><br><br>
Testing options include:
<br><br>
<ul style="margin-top: 25px;">
    <li>Cleaning</li>
    <li>Visual inspection/Air test</li>
    <li>Electrical Test</li>
    <li>Re-certification sheet/Packing Slip</li>
</ul>
Other testing services include hot sticks, blankets, sleeves, ats, and line hoses.

<h2>Glove Exchange Program</h2>
<br>
Taking glove testing to another level, Conney Safety has partnered with HI-Line to bring you in the Glove Exchange Pro- gram. The program ensures that rubber products, such as rubber gloves, meet or exceed ASTM standards and OSHA regulations while maximizing product usage. Skip the worry about when to send in your gloves for testing â€” we take care of everything, including:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Storing Gloves and Rubber Products</li>
    <li>Managing Glove Rotations</li>
    <li>Testing and Shipping</li>
</ul>
<br>
The program includes automated scheduled exchanges of your electrical gloves and rubber products; rotating gloves from your personal inventory; and ready-to-use, tested gloves sent to your location when they need to be exchanged in the field. Once your next cycle of gloves arrives, you'll simply return your current set to our testing lab to be cleaned, visually inspected, and placed into a temperature controlled storage area ready for the next cycle.
<br><br>
In addition to glove testing, this program can also include testing and rotations for sleeves, blankets, hoods, boots, line hoses, and more.
