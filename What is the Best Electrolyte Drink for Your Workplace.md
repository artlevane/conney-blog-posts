<h2 class="intro">Keep your employees hydrated and in good health by providing them with both water and the best electrolyte drinks.</h2>
<br>
Did you know that dehydration is the leading cause of most heat illnesses and that workers can sweat about one liter per hour when doing heavy work?
<br><br>
That's why proper hydration becomes even more critical in certain work environments that involve high levels of physical labor or exertion.
<br><br>
Dehydration can result in reduced endurance, reduced cognitive function, decreased attention span, muscle cramps and decreased physical performance.
<br><br>
By ensuring employees are adequately hydrated via water and electrolyte solutions, employers can help prevent fatigue and improve physical capabilities, leading to better work outcomes and reduced risk of workplace accidents or injuries.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Symptoms of Dehydration That Require Immediate Care</h3>
<br>
If a member of your workforce is experiencing even one of these symptoms, immediate emergency treatment is necessary.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Altered behavior, such as severe anxiety, confusion or not being able to stay awake</li>
    <li>Faintness that is not relieved by lying down or light-headedness that continues after standing for two minutes</li>
    <li>A weak, rapid pulse</li>
    <li>Cold, clammy skin or hot, dry skin</li>
    <li>Little or no urination</li>
    <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Tips for Preventing Dehydration and Fluid Loss</h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Drink water or our best electrolyte drinks before, during and after your shift (8-10 glasses per day).</li>
    <li>Drink 5-7 ounces of water or our best electrolyte drinks every 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Keep cool water or our best electrolyte drinks within easy reach at all times.</li>
    <li>Drink cool water or our best electrolyte drinks, as they are absorbed quicker than either warm or very cold liquids.</li>
    <li>Try to avoid coffee, tea and soda when on the job. They increase urine output and make you dehydrate faster.</li>
    <li>Never drink alcohol during work. Drinking alcohol after work further dehydrates you as well.</li>
    <li>Wear one layer of lightweight, light-colored clothing when working outdoors.</li>
    <li>Anticipate conditions that will increase the need for more hydration, including high temperatures, humidity, wearing of protective clothing and the difficulty of the job.</li>
    <li>Stop working outdoors or in the heat at the first sign of dizziness, lightheadedness or fatigue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Guide in Choosing an Electrolyte Beverage this Summer</h3>
<br>
You don’t have to be a competitive athlete to consume electrolyte supplements like Gatorade, Sqwincher, or other brands. The average person can encounter 27.4 to 47.3oz of fluid lost through sweat each hour during strenuous activity. This can have a major impact on your overall health. 
<br><br>
When selecting the electrolyte beverage that’s ideal for your workplace, it’s important to pay attention to the amounts of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium present in each serving. Also, keep in mind that not all electrolytes are created equal. Let’s discuss the options you have to replace your fluids and electrolytes.
