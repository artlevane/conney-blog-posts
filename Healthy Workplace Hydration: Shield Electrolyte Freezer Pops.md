That's why proper hydration becomes even more critical in certain work environments that involve high levels of physical labor or exertion.
<br><br>
Dehydration can result in reduced endurance, reduced cognitive function, decreased attention span, muscle cramps and decreased physical performance.

By ensuring employees are adequately hydrated via Shield Electrolyte Freeze Pops and other Shield Electrolyte Hydration products, employers can help prevent fatigue and improve physical capabilities, leading to better work outcomes and reduced risk of workplace accidents or injuries.
