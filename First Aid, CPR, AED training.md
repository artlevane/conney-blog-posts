<h2 class="intro">First Aid, CPR, AED training</h2>
<br>

Is your staff trained to respond appropriately in the event of a medical emergency? OSHA requires employers to provide medical and first aid personnel/supplies commensurate with the hazards of the workplace.
<br>
Conney Safety's First Aid/CPR/AED course provides the training your company needs to be in compliance with OSHA's Medical Services and First Aid standard (29 CFR 1910.151).
<br>
During this course employees will learn:

<br><br>
Recognize a medical emergency

Handle breathing and cardiac emergencies

Act appropriately and sustain life until professional help arrives

Prevent disease transmission

Identify and care for bleeding, sudden illness and injuries

Bloodborne pathogens
