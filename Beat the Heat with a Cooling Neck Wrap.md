<h2 class="intro">A cooling neck wrap is an ideal solution for outdoor workers or anyone who is susceptible to heat-related illnesses.</h2>
<br>
The cooling neck wrap is designed to help cool down the body by lowering the temperature around the neck. They are typically made of materials that have cooling properties, such as gel, water-absorbing crystals or evaporative fabric.
<br><br>
Cooling neck wraps work by using a combination of evaporative cooling and conduction to dissipate heat from the body. When the cooling material is soaked in water or refrigerated, it absorbs the heat from the body and releases it through the process of evaporation. As the moisture evaporates, it cools the skin, providing relief from the heat.
<br><br>
<h2>Why Should I Get a Cooling Neck Wrap?</h2>
Cooling neck wraps are an ideal solution for outdoor workers or anyone who is susceptible to <a href="https://conney.com/websphere/blog/posts/beat-heat-stress-with-ergodyne-chill-its.html?utm_medium=cooling-neck-wrap&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney">heat-related illnesses</a> such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat stress can affect anyone that spends an extended period of time outdoors in the elements. It&rsquo;s important to understand the symptoms of heat stress so you can combat the illness before it gets worse.
<br><br>
<h2>What are the symptoms of heat-related illnesses?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heat Cramps - Symptoms are painful spasms of the muscles. Heat cramps are caused when workers consume large quantities of water but fail to take in enough salt to replace the salt their body lost through sweating. Tired muscles are most susceptible to cramping.</li>
<li>Heat Exhaustion - Symptoms for this disorder are moist, clammy, pale skin; profuse sweating; extreme weakness or fatigue; dry mouth; dizziness; fast pulse; rapid breathing; muscle cramps and nausea.</li>
<li>Heat/Sun Stroke - Symptoms are a very high body temperature (104&deg;F or higher); lack of sweat; mental confusion, delirium, or hallucinations; deep breathing and rapid pulse; hot, dry, red or mottled skin; and dilated pupils. Seek medical help at once for this condition.</li>
</ul>

There are many benefits to wearing a cooling neck wrap while outside.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>The cooling neck wrap will help keep your body from overheating if you wear it while you are working and/or while you are taking a break. It becomes a cooling system to help regulate your core body temperature, even if your body cannot regulate its temperature itself.</li>
    <li>Cooling neck wraps can also help those most prone to overheating, especially emergency responders, construction workers, and anyone working outside. The combination of exposure, exertion, and requirement to wear protective gear that could potentially trap heat put these individuals at risk.</li>
    <li>While the cooling neck wrap or towel requires water to activate its effectiveness, they are not wet to the touch, making them comfortable to wear all day long, while providing the benefits of evaporative technology.</li>
    <li>These wraps and towels can remain effective for five or more hours per day with one activation.</li>
    <li>They are very easy to recharge or reactivate. All it takes is moistening the towel, then whipping it or snapping it in the air like a lasso. It is best to apply the wrap or towel to the neck at the hottest portion of the day.</li>
    <li>The cooling neck wrap can provide a 20-degree difference between the air temperature and the surface of their skin.</li>
</ul>
