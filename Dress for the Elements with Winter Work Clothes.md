<h2 class="intro">Be prepared for biting winds, blinding snow and sub-zero temperatures by selecting proper winter work clothes.</h2>
<br>
If you’ve ever worked outside during winter, you know it can be a beast. Biting winds, blinding snow and sub-zero temperatures add new risks to your workday. While those working outdoors in winter weather or working in cold environments for extended periods are most at risk, the effects of cold stress can take anyone down. Proper winter work clothes are vital for safety and efficiency while on the job.
<br><br>
The body reacts to cold stress in a logical, systematic manner. As conditions worsen, the body shifts into survival mode by redirecting warmth and blood flow to blood vessels in the most critical area – the body’s core. Extremities like the hands and feet are the first affected areas. Eventually, the body lowers all skin temperature and internal body temperature.
<br><br>
<h2>Winter Work Clothes and Safety</h2>
In order to protect your body from the elements, it is important to understand what needs protection and how to protect it. Depending on the severity of the elements and the task at hand, it may be tricky to find the right balance between dexterity, comfort, and flexibility to suit your needs. 
<br><br>
It is also important to select all the components of winter work clothes, including a jacket, work pants, socks, gloves, etc. Regardless of what you choose to roll with, there are signs of cold stress that are vital to look out for.
<br><br>
<h3>Keep an Eye on Hands and Feet</h3>
This is where hypothermia, frostbite and trench foot will appear first. <a href="https://www.conney.com/brands/little-hotties?utm_medium=Winter-Covid&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Little-Hotties&utm_medium=winter-work-clothes&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney">Hand warmers, toe warmers and insulated insoles</a> are essential. If any of the symptoms listed below are present, get into a warm location, remove wet winter work clothing and drink something warm until medical help arrives.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hypothermia</strong>: As body heat is lost, the body can no longer sustain its internal temperature. In order of increasing severity, symptoms start with shivering (which ends when exposure continues), bluish skin, slurred speech, loss of coordination, confusion, disorientation, inability to walk or stand, dilated pupils, slowed pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness and potentially death.</li>
    <li><strong>Frostbite</strong>: Freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. Frostbite typically affects the extremities, particularly the feet and hands. Symptoms include reddened skin with gray/white patches, numbness, tingling/stinging, affected skin feels firm or hard, blue waxy skin and skin blisters.</li>
    <li><strong>Trench Foot</strong>: Reduced circulation and skin death in the foot, caused by prolonged exposure to wet and cold temperatures. Symptoms include redness of the skin, swelling, numbness and blisters.</li>
</ul>
