<h2 class="intro">A fall protection rescue plan is an important component of any comprehensive safety program for workers at heights.</h2>
<br>
By having a fall protection rescue plan in place, your employees will be better prepared to assist and rescue a co-worker who has either fallen from an elevated surface or become suspended at height.
<br><br>
OSHA requires a fall rescue plan when workers are working above ground. Your fall rescue plan should be tailored to your worksite and should consider the specific hazards and risks associated with the work being performed.
<br><br>
Please note that this article discusses elements of both, a fall rescue plan, and a fall protection plan, which deals more with fallen worker rescue. You can read more about <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/ansi-assp-z359-1-2020-fall-protection-code-asse/#gref?utm_medium=fall-protection-rescue-plan&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=ANSI">the Fall Protection Code</a> released by ANSI in 2021.
<br><br>
<h2>What Does a Typical Fall Protection Rescue Plan Look Like?</h2>
A typical fall protection rescue plan includes information on the types of fall protection equipment to be used, the roles and responsibilities of workers and rescuers and the steps to be taken in case of an emergency.
<br><br>
Here are some of the main steps that you may want to include in your fall rescue plan:
<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>Identify potential fall hazards on your jobsite and assess the risk associated with them.</li>
    <li>Develop and implement fall protection measures to minimize the risk of falls. Consider the use of personal fall arrest systems, guardrails, a self-retracting lifeline, or other forms of fall protection.</li>
    <li>Develop a rescue plan that outlines procedures for rescuing workers who have fallen or become suspended at height. The rescue plan should include details such as who will be responsible for carrying out the rescue, what equipment will be used and how the rescue will be coordinated.</li>
    <li>Train all workers and managers on the rescue plan and conduct regular drills to ensure that everyone is prepared in case of an emergency.</li>
    <li>Establish communication protocols to ensure that workers can easily and quickly report emergencies and summon help when needed. Include information on how to contact emergency services.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all rescue equipment is properly maintained and readily available when needed to increase the likelihood that a prompt rescue proceeds quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li>Conduct regular inspections of your personal fall protection equipment to ensure it is in working order.</li>
    <li>Document all aspects of the rescue plan, including risk assessments, fall protection measures, and rescue procedures, and make this information readily available to workers and emergency responders.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
By following these steps, employers can help to ensure that workers are protected from falls and that they are prepared to respond quickly and effectively in case of an emergency.

<h3>Unique Factors to Consider During a Confined Space Rescue</h3>
<br>
Confined spaces are areas that are not intended for continuous occupancy and are typically difficult to enter and exit, such as: tanks, silos, sewers, tunnels and manholes.
<br><br>
And while a confined space rescue may not necessarily involve a fall, it does typically involve the use of fall protection rescue equipment to retrieve an individual who is trapped or injured in a confined space.
<br><br>
Confined space rescues require careful planning and execution to ensure the safety of everyone involved. The rescue team must be able to access the confined space and safely remove the victim while avoiding a variety of hazards, including toxic gasses, lack of oxygen, and physical obstacles.
<br><br>
A confined space rescue can involve some or all of the following fall protection rescue products: harnesses, ropes, retrieval equipment, ventilation systems, gas detectors, communication devices and personal protective equipment.
