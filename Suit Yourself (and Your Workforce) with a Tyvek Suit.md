<h2 class="intro">DuPont Tyvek Suits are both durable and comfortable, providing an excellent barrier against dangerous fine particles and chemicals.</h2>
<br>
If you are looking for a full hazmat suit or just some light protection, Tyvek Suits are a great way to stay protected while handling your task.
<br><br>
No matter what the brand or trade name, almost all limited-use clothing can be classified into one of a few general fabric technologies. In order to select the appropriate protective garment, it is important to understand how well the fabric used in the garment provides a barrier to specific hazardous materials.
<br><br>
<h2>Popular Tyvek Suit Fabrics</h2>
<br>
Check out the following list to learn more about the most popular fabrics used in limited-use protective clothing and their unique properties.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>DuPont™ Tychem® is specifically engineered for protection over a range of biological and chemical hazards. The barrier fabrics and construction methods used in Tychem suits help prevent penetration and permeation by chemical hazards. Tychem fabrics offer several levels of protection. Tychem 2000 SFR garments add secondary flame protection, and Tychem 6000 FR garments offer triple hazard protection from liquid-chemical splash, flash fire and electric arc.</li>
    <li>DuPont™ Tyvek® suits are composed of 100% flash spun high-density polyethylene which creates a unique, nonwoven material providing a balance of protection, durability and comfort. Tyvek is an inherent barrier to small-sized hazardous particles. Protection is built into the fabric itself. There are no films or laminates to abrade or wear away.  In fact, tests prove the Tyvek barrier is more than twice as durable as microporous film or SMS fabrics. Tyvek suits can only handle a light liquid splash, so it is typically used for protecting against dry substances such as dust.</li>
    <li>Microporous fabric is made up of a laminat ed microporous film layer over spunbonded polypropylene nonwoven fabric. Microporous clothing provides protection against non-hazardous liquids and some particles. This fabric works best in wet areas where keeping cool is of concern.</li>
    <li>Spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS) SMS is a three-ply material consisting of one layer of meltblown polypropylene bonded between two layers of spunbond polypropylene. Soft, fluid-repellent, anti-static and breathable; SMS provides an optimal mix of protection and comfort. It is appropriate for extended-wear situations involving low to moderate non-toxic fluid contact.</li>
    <li>Spunbond polypropylene apparel is formed by bonding fibers together to become a single layer of breathable, woven-like material. Its main advantages are economy, comfort and breathability. It provides light, non-toxic fluid protection, but negligible barrier protection.</li>
    <li>Polyolefin clothing is a soft and breathable microporous fabric that is an economical alternative to Tyvek suits. This limited-use clothing is suitable for jobs such as food processing, paint spraying/finishing operations, asbestos and mold abatement, fiberglass work, and general maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
The Tyvek suit is generally preferred for many different types of jobs where protection is necessary.

<h2>Other Tyvek Suit Considerations</h2>
<br>
<h3>Consider Seam Construction</h3>
When selecting disposable garments such as a DuPont Tyvek suit, always consider which style of seam construction is most appropriate for your application.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Serged or Sewn Seams feature threads which interlock around the raw edges of two pieces of material. They are strong and stress resistant. Serged seams can be degraded by some hazardous liquid chemicals, such as strong acids, and should not be worn when these chemicals are present.</li>
    <li>Bound Seams are tightly sewn with a reinforced outer binding. They are ideal for potential misting exposure to non-hazardous liquids or particle penetration. Bound seams can be degraded by some hazardous liquid chemicals, such as strong acids, and should not be worn when these chemicals are present.</li>
    <li>Taped Seams are sewn and taped to provide strong resistance to chemical splashes and physical stress.</li>
    <li>Double Taped Seams are sewn and taped on the inside and outside for strong resistance to chemicals and physical stress.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>Fit and Comfort Matter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Check how the clothing feels when stretching or bending. Range of movement is critical to performing many jobs. If your Tyvek suits are tight in the arms or through the back, your mobility will be compromised.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the fit and comfort. You don't want to wear baggy Tyvek suits that are constantly getting caught on various objects or machines in the workplace, yet you want it to be loose enough that it remains comfortable.</li>
    <li>Determine if the apparel is easy to put on and take off. If you're going to be wearing Tyvek suits regularly, you don't want putting it on to be a daily struggle.</li>
    <li>Choose Tyvek suits that are reinforced in high-stress areas. The result will be fewer blowouts.</li>
</ul>
