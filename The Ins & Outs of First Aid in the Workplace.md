<h2 class="intro">The Ins &amp; Outs of First Aid in the Workplace</h2>
<br>
There's no doubt that emergency preparedness and first aid are incredibly complex topics. On top of that, the OSHA and ANSI guidance on these areas can be difficult to decipher and determine the best action plan for your work environment. But no matter what sort of facility you work in, first aid is an integral part of any workplace safety plan.
<br><br>
The fact of the matter is that injuries happen&endash;and you're required to have the appropriate first aid supplies on-hand to deal with any incidences that need immediate attention.
<br><br>
<h2>OSHA and ANSI First Aid Standards</h2>
<br>
From OSHA recommendations to ANSI standards, there's a lot of information out there, so it's often difficult to determine the appropriate approach to take when it comes to housing first aid supplies in your facility. We're here to help guide you in making decisions that keep your workers safe and your workplace compliant. Below, we've provided guidance on OSHA's first aid recommendations and ANSI's first aid standards, the differences between Class A and Class B kits, as well as information on a variety of first aid options and services we have available for you! 
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>OSHA First Aid Recommendations<ol>
<li>According to OSHA Regulation Standard 1910.151(a), "The employer shall ensure the ready availability of medical personnel for advice and consultation on matters of plant health." OSHA also provides "non-mandatory" recommendations that coincide with the ANSI Z308.1-2015 Standard.
<br>
Due to OSHA's Regulation being fairly broad in scope, we always recommend following the ANSI Standard to ensure full compliance. It's also worth noting that some states even require following the ANSI Standard.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>ANSI First Aid Compliance<ol>
<li>Through the ANSI Z308.1-2015 standard, ANSI has established minimum performance requirements for first aid kits and their supplies. First aid kits are classified based on the assortment and quantity of first aid supplies intended to deal with most types of injuries and sudden illnesses that may be encountered in the workplace. These may include major and minor wounds, minor burns, sprains and strains, and eye injuries. As each work environment is unique, it is expected that the contents of each kit is supplemented as needed based upon the recommendations of a person competent in first aid.
<br>
Because of the intricacy of the topic of first aid, determining a first aid solution that is not only ANSI-compliant, but also best suited to your work environment can be cumbersome. Depending on the type of facility you work in, you may be required to house either Class A kits or Class B kits. Often, we find that facilities that only require a Class A kit may actually be using a Class B kit, which is an unnecessary waste of money and resources. Below, we've detailed the differences between the kits to help you determine what's best for your unique work environment.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What's the Difference Between Class A and Class B First Aid Kits?<ol>
<li>The ANSI Z308.1-2015 Standard introduces two classes of first aid kits: Class A and Class B. The Class A kits include contents designed for the most common types of workplace injuries, while Class B kits include a broader range and quantity of supplies to deal with injuries in more complex or high-risk environments. The standard also classifies the kit container into four different types (I-IV). The assortment and quantity of supplies included in the kits were chosen based upon reviews of workplace incidents requiring first aid treatment, similar international standards, and current injury treatment practices. The quantity and size specifications given are the minimum necessary to comply with the standard.</li>

We can customize facility audits to focus on specific issues (i.e., first aid), as well as interview employees to gather valuable feedback. We’ll also provide a detailed report documenting the activity of the auditor. Facility/department safety audits are dependent on the following:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>What is the size of the facility?</li>
    <li>Is it a comprehensive vs. topic specific audit?</li>
    <li>How much time is allowed to tour the facility?</li>
    <li>What are the expectations of the written report?</li>
</ul>
