<h2 class="intro">Respiratory medical evaluations (online)</h2>
<br>

Prior to respiratory protection fit testing, employees need to be medically cleared to wear the device. Only healthcare professionals who are licensed, certified, or registered by the state or certified agencies can perform these evaluations. The cost and time for obtaining a medical evaluation is at the employer's expense.

Conney Safety offers OSHA compliant online medical evaluations at the low cost of $29.00/employee. This cost-effective option allows employees toÂ omplete a questionnaire in the workplace, without needing to be sent to an expensive medical facility for evaluation. It is required to register online (20-minute process) with passwords provided for employees to access the medical evaluation. A 90% pass rate is typical.
