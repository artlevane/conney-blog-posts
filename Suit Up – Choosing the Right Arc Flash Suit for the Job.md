<h2 class="intro">Choosing the right arc flash clothing and/or arc flash suit depends on your electrical safety requirements.</h2>
<br>
The arc flash suit consists of a set of flame resistant clothing that protects workers from serious injury or sickness from electrical arc flash hazards, including coveralls, leggings, aprons, footwear, smocks, gloves, pants, jackets, and vests. The strength of the material is dependent on the minimum arc rating required for the specific task, which is determined by the level of risk involved. Arc flash suits are tiered into four hazard risk categories.  
<br><br>
Regular work clothes can easily catch on fire by an electric arc flash. The risk of serious injury is greatly reduced when the arc flash suit is worn in the presence of these electrical hazards. What should you look for when selecting the suit that&rsquo;s right for you and/or your team? Let&rsquo;s examine the attributes more closely.
<br><br>
<h2>What is the NFPA 70E 2018 standard for arc flash clothing and arc flash suits?</h2>
The NFPA 70E standard addresses electrical safety work practices and procedures for employees who work on or near exposed, energized electrical equipment. This standard requires employees to wear arc rated (AR) clothing that meets the requirements of ASTM F1959 whenever there is a possibility of an arc flash and the employee is within the restricted approach or arc flash boundaries.
<br><br>
Prior to the performance of live work, employees must perform a risk assessment to determine the likelihood and severity of an arc flash to develop based on their work.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>Is compliance with NFPA 70E mandatory?</h2>
No. NFPA 70E is a national consensus safety standard published by NFPA primarily to assist OSHA in preparing electrical safety standards. Federal OSHA has not incorporated it into the Code of Federal Regulations.
<br><br>
However, in the event of an injury or death due to an electrical accident, if OSHA determines that compliance with 70E would have prevented or lessened the injury, OSHA may cite the employer under the general duty clause.
<br><br>
<h2>What happens to clothing during an electrical arc flash?</h2>
Electrical arcs can reach temperatures in excess of 35,000 degrees which instantly melts and then vaporizes electrical conductors into combustible plasma gas. This gas rapidly expands due to the superheating of air which produces a concussive blast that propels molten shrapnel at speeds that exceed the speed of sound; NFPA refers to this condition as arc blast.
<br><br>
A byproduct of arc blast is blast overpressure which is produced when the blast shock wave reaches the sound barrier. Blast overpressure is fatal even down to 2 pounds per square inch where it crushes hollow organ systems such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. For these reasons, 40cal/cm2 is the largest arc flash exposure that PPE can protect against.
<br><br>
<h2>How do I choose the correct arc flash clothing and/or arc flash suit?</h2>

Choosing the right arc flash clothing and/or arc flash suit depends on your electrical safety requirements. The higher the incident energy level at the point of work, the higher arc-rated PPE you&rsquo;ll need. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) uses four Arc Flash PPE Categories to classify the range of hazards. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the clothing and PPE required at each level:
