<h2 class="intro">Learn more about the key glove categories and how they can help protect your workers in their unique applications.</h2>
<br>
Disposable, chemical-resistant, cut-resistant, and impact-resistant gloves are commonly used in a variety of work settings. Learn more about some of the basics of these gloves and things you should take into consideration before purchasing a certain type of glove within each respective category.
<br><br>
<h2>Disposable Gloves</h2>
Disposable gloves offer limited chemical protection and are intended to be used as a simple barrier between the skin and the product, while allowing greater dexterity and sensitivity with the fingers. Disposable gloves are normally intended as a single-use glove.
<br><br>
<strong>Disposable Glove Options</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Latex rubber</li>
    <li>Nitrile</li>
    <li>Vinyl</li>
    <li>Synthetic</li>
    <li>Polyethylene</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disposable Glove Selection Considerations</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Exam gloves are approved for blood (must state it meets FDA standards as an exam glove).</li>
    <li>Powdered gloves aid in donning and doffing.</li>
    <li>Some latex gloves are listed as low protein and offer less chance of promoting an allergy (nitrile gloves are a particularly good solution to allergies).</li>
    <li>Varying thickness of 1 to 9 mil (1 mil = 1/1,000”).</li>
    <li>Disposable gloves are now being tested to determine how they react to Fentanyl handling.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h2>Chemical-Resistant Gloves</h2>
Chemical-resistant gloves help provide protection from a wide range of chemicals as well as from nuisance hand injuries (when supported gloves are used). Keep in mind that there is not one single glove that will provide maximum protection against all chemicals.
<br><br>
<strong>Chemical-Resistant Glove Options</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Latex rubber</li>
    <li>Nitrile</li>
    <li>PVC (vinyl)</li>
    <li>Neoprene</li>
    <li>Butyl</li>
    <li>PVA</li>
    <li>Viton</li>
    <li>Silvershield</li>
</ul>
<strong>Chemical-Resistant Glove Selection Considerations</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Supported gloves have a liner that provides additional cut/puncture protection, helps with temperature extremes, and absorbs sweat.</li>
    <li>Unsupported gloves are less expensive, have a true thickness listed, and generally have better dexterity.</li>
    <li>Some chemical gloves are cotton flock lined to make the glove easier to slide glove on/off and provide more comfort while wearing (additionally, separate liners can be added to unsupported gloves to achieve similar benefits of a built-in liner (from a supported glove).</li>
    <li>Conney’s Safety Support Team can help identify which glove provides the best chemical resistance for every situation; we review both permeation and degradation data to help give you the best options to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Chemical-Resistant Glove Selection Process</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Determine the work application</li>
    <li>Determine the exact chemicals involved (Ansell’s GUARDIAN® program is a proprietary service that can help you select the right PPE with regard to the type of chemical being handled; learn more about this program today)</li>
    <li>If applicable, determine what kind of glove had previously been used</li>
    <li>Choose supported or unsupported gloves</li>
    <li>Determine the length of glove needed</li>
    <li>Review the chemical guidelines for using/maintaining the glove</li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<h2>Cut-Resistant Gloves</h2>
Cut-resistant gloves provide varying degrees of cut and laceration protection to the wearer, primarily dependent on the type of material used and the thickness. Thinner style gloves can be used as a liner. The ANSI standard classifies glove cut resistance, ranking A1 through A9—A1 being the lowest indicator of cut resistance and A9 being the highest indicator. There also is an EN388 or European standard of cut resistance, ranking A through F, where A is the lowest indicator of cut resistance and F is the highest indicator.
<br><br>
<strong>Cut-Resistant Glove Options</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Kevlar®</li>
    <li>Spectra/Dyneema</li>
    <li>Stainless steel strands</li>
    <li>Synthetic/composite fiber yarn (like UHMWPE or HPPE)</li>
    <li>Fiberglass</li>
    <li>Metal mesh</li>
    <li>Basalt (mineral-based fiber)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cut-Resistant Glove Selection Considerations</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Coated vs. Uncoated – Coated gloves may have PVC dots or other material to give a better grip to the slippery surface of this category of glove</li>
    <li>FDA accepted food gloves can have no dots</li>
    <li>Coatings on dipped gloves may be polyurethane, nitrile, foam nitrile, latex, PVC, or blends of different coatings</li>
    <li>Metal mesh has the highest level of cut protection and is a repairable product</li>
    <li>Kevlar® is pound-for-pound stronger than steel and is available in various thicknesses</li>
</ul>
