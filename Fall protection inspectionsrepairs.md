<h2 class="intro">Fall protection inspections/repairs</h2>
<br>

Fall protection violations continue to rank #1 with OSHA&endash;let us help take some of the worry away from your inspection process. Conney will inspect, repair, and certify your fall protection devices such as winches, self-retracting lifelines (SRLs), and other fall protection equipment. We work directly with manufacturers like 3M/Capital Safety, Miller Fall Protection, MSA, and others to keep your equipment working safely.
<br>
Fall protection manufacturers require that a Competent Person inspect your fall protection equipment at least once per year. Our Safety Services team is trained to provide these inspections for those without someone trained as a Competent Person (we also offerÂ Competent Person training) or when third-party documentation is needed. We can provide a quote to inspect your equipment on-site or devices can be shipped to our Madison, Wisconsin location for inspection/documentation in-house.

Have more expensive SRLs that are damaged or have been involved in a fall? We can facilitate getting these units repaired too.
