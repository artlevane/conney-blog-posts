<h2 class="intro">NARCAN Nasal Spray is designed to rapidly reverse the effects of a life-threatening opioid emergency.</h2>
<br>
In the event of an opioid overdose, time is critical. NARCAN Nasal Spray is designed to rapidly reverse the effects of a life-threatening opioid emergency. It is used to revive someone during an overdose from many prescription pain medications or street drugs such as heroin and is available as an over-the-counter treatment.
<br><br>
<h2>Should I Add NARCAN® Nasal Spray to My First Aid Kit?</h2>
<br>
Yes, Including NARCAN Nasal Spray (Naloxone HCI) in your first aid kit is a proactive step that can make a significant difference in an emergency situation. Having NARCAN on hand allows you to act immediately while waiting for emergency medical services to arrive.

Having NARCAN in your first aid kit is especially a good idea if you are in an environment where opioid use might be present, such as if you or someone in your workplace takes prescription opioids, or if you work in a community where opioid misuse is a concern.
