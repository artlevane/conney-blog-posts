<h2 class="intro">Mechanics gloves not only protect your hands, but also allow you to safely feel, grip and maneuver materials, parts and/or machinery.</h2>
If you have a heavy-duty job, protect your hands with mechanics gloves.
<br><br>
While they may be called "mechanics gloves," this style of hand protection is so versatile, flexible and dexterous that it provides effective protection to workers in any warehouse, construction site, assembly line, machine shop, agricultural job, automotive shop or virtually any industrial setting.
<br><br>
It's critical that everyone in a workplace has gloves that not only protect their hands, but also allows them to safely feel, grip and maneuver materials, parts and/or machinery. Mechanics gloves may be the right choice for you if you face any of the following hazards on a regular basis: 
<ul>
<li>
Cuts to hands and arms from handling abrasive parts and materials

</li>
<li>
Impeded sense of touch

</li>
<li>
Burns from handling hot objects

</li>
<li>
Potential arm injuries from reaching, stretching or twisting

</li>
<li>
Exposure to sprayed or splashed chemicals

</li>
<li>
Flying debris from tasks involving welding or grinding

</li>
<li>
Risk of electrocution

</li>
<li>
Potential crush injuries from heavy or falling objects

</li>
</ul>
A good pair of mechanics gloves allows workers to keep better control over their work at all times. Because of their lighter weight and dexterity, they provide superior control and precision for workers who need to quickly and repeatedly adjust as they do various daily tasks.

<h2>Choosing the Right Size of Mechanics Gloves</h2>
Because different glove manufacturers use different methods for determine glove size, knowing how to properly measure your hand is critical.
<br><br>
Most mechanics gloves are sized based on either the circumference (total distance around) or width (distance across one side) of your hand.
<ul>
<li>
To determine either circumference (total distance around) or width (distance across one side), measure the widest area of your hand – the space just below your knuckles at the palm (excluding the thumb). This is typically done using a soft cloth tape measure. If you are right-handed, take measurements from your right hand. If you are left-handed, from your left. This is because your dominant hand is typically your largest hand.

</li>
</ul>
Another method manufacturers use to determine glove size is the length of your hand.
<ul>
<li>
Hand length is determined by measuring from the base of your palm to the tip of your middle finger.

</li>
</ul>
Once you have these measurements, you'll want to go to the manufacturer's website to determine what size glove you need. Most every major glove manufacturer will have a sizing chart on their website. If you are unable to find the sizing chart you need, please contact our<a href="https://www.conney.com/pages/safetyservices?utm_medium=Mechanics-Gloves&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Safety-Support-Team"> Safety Support Team</a> and they will be happy to assist you.
