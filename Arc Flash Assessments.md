<h2 class="intro">Arc Flash Assessments</h2>
<br>
It is critical that sound arc flash risk assessment programs are in place to support employees in making appropriate decisions on a daily basis. Conney Safety partners with National Electrical Contractors to offer various package options to properly identify and label electrical systems and production control panels to both NFPA 70E compliance and OSHA expectations. Our focus is on safe work practices vs. some common national trends on performing arc flash studies which can sometimes leave employers searching for more help.
<br>
Properly conducted safety auditing programs can determine the minimum PPE workers must wear when they are near exposed energized equipment, and in many cases, our team can help recommend solutions to lower equipment hazards. We are here to help you build long-term programs that are based on real life practical applications of OSHA codes and NFPA 70E alike.
