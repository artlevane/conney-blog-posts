<h2 class="intro">With proper safety training, procedures and construction PPE, the risk of workplace accidents and injuries can be greatly reduced.</h2>
<br>
There are many hazards present in the construction industry. It is important for all construction workers to be aware of construction safety and to take steps to protect themselves and others. With proper safety training, procedures and construction PPE (personal protective equipment), the risk of accidents and injuries can be greatly reduced.
<br><br>
<h2>Types of Construction Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2>
<br>
<h3>Construction PPE for Your Head</h3>
<br>
Choosing the right hard hat for your work environment is crucial to ensuring that your head is protected from falling objects resulting in head injuries.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>The most common type of hard hat is the <a href="https://www.conney.com/category/head-protection-hard-hats?utm_medium=construction-ppe&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney">Type I hard hat</a>. It is intended to reduce the force of impact resulting from a blow only to the top of the head.</li>
    <li>Type II hard hats are intended to reduce the force of lateral impact resulting from a blow which may be received off-center, from the side, from behind, or to the top of the head. Type II hard hats are typically lined on the inside with a thick high-density foam.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Construction PPE for Your Eyes</h3>
<br>
Wearing eye protection on a jobsite is important to prevent eye injuries that can occur from flying debris, dust, chemicals, and other hazards. Did you know that 90% of workplace injuries are preventable if the user had been wearing protective safety glasses? In fact, approximately 60% of workers with eye injuries were not wearing the right kind of eye protection!
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Construction PPE for Your Ears</h3>
<br>
On a construction site, there are many sources of loud noises, including heavy machinery, power tools and other equipment. As a result, it is important to wear hearing protection to prevent hearing damage. From reusable and disposable ear plugs to hearing bands to earmuffs – each product offers different levels of protection and comfort, so it is important to choose the right hearing protection product for your needs.

<h3>Construction PPE for Your Hands</h3>
<br>
Wearing hand protection on a construction site is vital to preventing hand injuries that can occur from handling sharp objects, working with power tools and performing other hazardous tasks. Hand protection can become worn, damaged or contaminated over time, which can reduce effectiveness. Chemical resistant gloves may also be necessary depending on the construction site. Be sure to maintain your hand protection and replace it as needed.

<h3>Construction PPE to Prevent Falls</h3>
<br>
The three basic components to any fall arrest system are Anchorage Connectors, Body Wear and Connecting Devices. Individually, these three items will not provide protection from a fall. However, when used in proper conjunction with each other they form a personal fall arrest system that becomes vitally important to fall protection safety on your jobsite.

<br><br>
This strap allows the worker who has been subject to a fall, and is suspended, to stand up in their harness and relieve the pressure being applied to the arteries and veins around the top of the legs. After a fall, the strap can be quickly and easily deployed and adjusted. The strap accommodates either having one foot or both feet in the loop at a time - it will relieve the pressure to both sides with just one foot in, allowing for added movement of the legs.
