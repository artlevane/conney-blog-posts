<h2 class="intro">We’ve detailed some useful information regarding hi-vis rain jackets and the ANSI/ISEA standard when working in hazardous traffic work zones.</h2>
<br>
There’s no doubt that outdoor traffic work zones come with a range of possible risks and dangers. From the threat of passing cars and inclement weather to the prevalence of heavy-duty equipment – there are plenty of daily challenges for your workforce.
<br><br>
In the United States, nearly 1 in every 5 construction workplace fatalities is from a struck-by injury (when a worker is hit by a piece of equipment or vehicle). OSHA has adopted the ANSI/ISEA 109-2020 standard (High Visibility Safety Apparel and Headwear) for employee use in certain workplace situations.
<br><br>
To reduce the risk of injury, it is important to stay dry and stay in visibility during wet weather with high visibility rain gear. Below we’ve detailed some useful information about the hi-vis rain jacket, the ANSI/ISEA standard and other things to consider when working in hazardous traffic work zones.
<br><br>
<h2>How well can others see me?</h2>
A question you may face in many work environments is, “How well can others see me?” Wearing the proper amount of hi-vis apparel and choosing the right color can sometimes mean the difference between life and death.
<br><br>
One thing to keep in mind is the amount of hi-vis material covering your apparel. The difference between Class 2 and Class 3 hi-vis wear is that Class 3 simply has more background material and reflective striping than Class 2. For safety reasons, many safety professionals have made it standard to outfit their workers in Class 3 garments.
<br><br>
While we see these products primarily being used on construction projects, they are continuing to be found beneficial in the factory and warehouse settings. These bright colors with retroreflective material help even more when it is dawn, dusk, or night; when bright colors might not be able to be seen as easily (for example, a headlight will reflect the light back off the retro-reflective striping on your hi-vis rain jacket).
<br>
<h2>What color should my hi-vis rain jacket be?</h2>
<br>
Color is a second factor you’ll want to consider when choosing a hi-vis jacket. If workers are working around orange barrels or cones, you may want to consider equipping them with lime hi-vis jackets (or vice versa if they are working around lime-colored products). This ensures workers stand out from cones and barrels. 
<br><br>
Jackets and vests are also produced with both lime and orange hi-vis colors. This can be a good option depending on the type of work environment.
<h2>What are the three classes of the ANSI/ISEA 109-2020 standard for hi-vis clothing?</h2>
<strong>ANSI Class 1 Hi-Vis Rain Jackets</strong> are used when work permits undivided attention to traffic and there is ample separation between worker and motor vehicles. Use them when backgrounds are not complex and vehicle/equipment speeds do not exceed 25 mph. This is referred to as a Type O (off-road) garment.
<ul>
    <li>Typical users: parking attendants and workers on sidewalks</li>
</ul>
<strong>ANSI Class 2 Hi-Vis Rain Jackets</strong> are for work in inclement weather and/or areas with complex backgrounds. Workers’ attention may be diverted from approaching traffic or worker is in closer proximity to traffic. Use them when traffic speeds are over 25 mph. Class 2 hi-vis rain jackets have more retroreflective material than a Class 1 jacket and have a Type R (Roadway) on the tag.
<ul>
    <li>Typical users: roadway construction workers, utility workers and survey crews</li>
</ul>
<strong>ANSI Class 3 Hi-Vis Rain Jackets</strong> are an ideal choice for workers who are exposed to high-speed traffic and/or conditions where visibility of workers may be reduced. They are also used in conditions where equipment operators perform tasks near pedestrian workers. 
<br><br>
Workers must be conspicuous through a full range of body motions at a minimum of 1,280 feet and identifiable as a person.  Class 2 hi-vis rain jackets have more background and retroreflective material than a Class 2 jacket and would also receive a Type R (Roadway) rating on the tag, similar to a Class 2 jacket.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Typical users</strong>: flaggers, roadway construction workers, utility workers, survey crews and emergency responders.</li>
</ul>
