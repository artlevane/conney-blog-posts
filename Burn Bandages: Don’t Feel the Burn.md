<h2 class="intro">By understanding the basics of burn injuries and burn bandages, you can contribute to provide treatment and support to those who have suffered a burn injury.</h2>
<br>
Burn injuries can come from a variety of sources, including fire, chemicals, electricity or even exposure to certain forms of radiation. First aid products, like burn bandages, will keep the affected area clean and protect it from infection.
<br><br>
Burns are one of the most painful workplace injuries because they can affect the skin, nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and bones. Internal organs, such as the lungs or the heart can also be burned.
<br><br>
By understanding the basics of burn injuries, you can contribute to prevention strategies, advocate for safety measures and provide basic treatment and support to those who have suffered a burn injury. In this article, we will discuss what burns are, what causes them, how to treat them, and where you can find the supplies to do so.

<h2>Burn Bandages: Identify and Treat</h2>
<h3>Identify: Degrees of Burns</h3>
The three degrees of burns are determined by the severity and depth of the burn on the affected area.
<ul>
    <li>First-Degree Burns typically include damage to only the outer layer of skin called the epidermis. This is the type of burn that you've probably received several times in your life when working with the kitchen stove or around other hot surfaces. A first-degree burn looks pink/red in color and does not form blisters or open wounds. There may be mild swelling and pain associated with this burn; however, this type of burn usually heals on its own in a few days when treated with burn ointments or creams and burn bandages or dressings.</li>
    <li>Second-Degree Burns include damage to both the epidermis and the second layer of skin called the dermis. The skin will usually swell, blister, and appear bright red in color. Because the dermis layer contains nerves, the pain may be quite severe. Many second-degree burns can be treated at home with burn ointments or creams and burn bandages or dressings. However, if the pain is getting worse with time here or you see pus or other fluid leaking from the burn, you will want to see a medical professional immediately. This type of burn can take one to three weeks to heal and may produce scarring.</li>
    <li>Third-Degree Burns are the most serious because they can lead to an infection, loss of body heat and shock due to fluid loss. A third-degree burn involves all three layers of skin down to the subcutaneous (fat) layer. Third-degree burns may also affect muscles, bones and other organs. A third-degree burn may appear black and charred or have patches of white, shiny and leathery skin. These burns may also weep or leak fluids. Third-degree burns require immediate treatment from a medical professional and may produce deep scars that will require cosmetic surgery and skin grafts.</li>
</ul>
