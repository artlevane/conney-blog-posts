<h2 class="intro">Construction safety helmets with chin straps offer exceptional protection from injuries when compared to traditional hard hats.</h2>
<br>
Across the construction industry, the popularity of construction safety helmets with chin straps continues to rise. Falls have consistently been one of the leading causes of construction worker deaths, and more companies are beginning to recognize that it's time for their trusty hard hats to be upgraded.
<br><br>
Over the past several years, our Safety Support Team has heard from dozens of general contractors who now require employees to wear safety helmets with chin straps instead of traditional hard hats.
<br><br>
This change in thinking has been brought on by the realization that ensuring head protection stays in place in the event of a fall is crucial to the safety of the worker &ndash; and that safety helmets with chin straps offer exceptional protection from injuries when compared to traditional hard hats.
<br><br>
Simply put, if an employee suffers a fall, a traditional hard hat will likely fall off his/her head. While a safety helmet with chin strap will most likely stay safely secured during a fall, greatly decreasing the chances of head injuries when the employee hits the ground.

<h2>What is the difference between a traditional hard hat and construction safety helmets?</h2>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A traditional hard hat</strong> is typically made of polyethylene and secured by an adjustable ratchet or pinlock suspension to produce custom fit.</li>
    <li><strong>Construction safety helmets</strong> are built using the same pressure diffusion technology as many outdoor sports helmets, such as those used for rock climbing, skiing, cycling, kayaking, etc. A safety helmet typically has a shorter brim and contains protective padding that provides ample impact protection. Additionally, safety helmets have built-in chin straps that keep the helmet securely on the head.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<h2>What is the OSHA standard for head protection?</h2>
OSHA requires employers to provide head protection to employees working in areas where there is the potential for head injuries due to falling or flying objects, electrical shock or other hazards. The specific requirements for head protection are detailed in OSHA Standard 1910.135. The standard requires that all head protection meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI) guidelines, which outline performance and testing criteria for hard hats and safety helmets.
<br><br>
<h2>Does OSHA require that hard hats have chin straps?</h2>
No. While OSHA does not require chin straps, they did publish a non-mandatory guideline (OSHA 1915, Subpart I, App A) which states: Proper fitting of hard hats is important to ensure that the hard hat will not fall off during work operations. In some cases, a chinstrap may be necessary to keep the hard hat on an employee's head.
<br><br>
So while wearing a chinstrap is not an OSHA requirement, if a task is being performed at height or in a manner that can cause the helmet to fall off a worker's head, then wearing a safety helmet with a chinstrap is probably a good idea.
