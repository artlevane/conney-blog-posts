<br>
A new revision of the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) fall protection standard for Self-Retracting Lifelines (SRLs) went into effect on August 1, 2023.
<br><br>
<h2>What Has Changed With the Latest ANSI Fall Protection Standard With Regards to Self-Retracting Lifelines?</h2>
<br>
All Self-Retracting Devices (SRDs)  manufactured after this date are required to conform to the new ANSI Z359.14-2021 standard. Products manufactured to meet the previous ANSI Z359.14 standard may continue to be used as long as the product continues to meet the inspection requirements as defined by the manufacturer, conducted at the recommended intervals by a Competent Person.
<br><br>
Here is a brief list of what has changed in this latest iteration of the ANSI fall protection standard [ANSI Z359.14-2021]:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>Simplification of SRD types and classes</li>
    <li>Standardization of labels and markings</li>
    <li>Enhanced product testing requirements</li>
    <li>Standardization of overhead performance</li>
</ul>

<br>
This 6' self-retracting lifeline (SRL) is designed to easily connect to most full body harnesses. SRL combines a lightweight design with industrial-strength durability and function to keep workers safe and comfortable. The smart activating brake system will stop a fall within inches to provide more protection at low heights. The consistently firm tension of the lifeline helps reduce dragging, snapping and trips.

    <li>High-capacity external energy absorber with impact indicator lets you know whether or not the unit has been deployed</li>
    <li>Integrated RFID tag allows you to easily record and access information on inspections, inventory and use</li>
    <li>Thermoplastic housing is durable</li>
    <li>Meets updated 2021 ANSI Class 1 and OSHA regulations</li>

Twin-leg SRL's provide continuous fall protection for workers who are ascending, descending or moving laterally. The unique design allows the user to attach one lifeline leg to the anchor point, move to a new location and connect the second, then disconnect the first and move again. 
<br><br>
This allows for 100% protection while moving from one location to another. The smart activating brake system will stop a fall within inches to provide more protection at low heights. The consistently firm tension of the lifeline helps reduce dragging, snapping and trips.
