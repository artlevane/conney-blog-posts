<h2 class="intro">NFPA 70E provides guidelines and best practices for protecting workers from electrical hazards.</h2>
<br>
Did you know that electrocution is the fifth leading cause of workplace fatalities in the U.S and that 97% of all electricians have been shocked or injured on the job?
<br><br>
Electrical hazards pose a significant risk in many workplaces. To mitigate these risks and ensure the safety of workers, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) developed NFPA 70E 2018, the standard for electrical safety in the workplace.
<br><br>
NFPA 70E provides guidelines and best practices for protecting workers from electrical hazards while working on or near energized electrical equipment. In this article, we'll delve into the key aspects of NFPA 70E, its significance, and how it helps create safer work environments.
<br><br>
<h2>What is the NFPA 70E 2018 standard?</h2>
<br>
The NFPA 70E standard addresses electrical safety work practices and procedures for employees who work on or near exposed, energized electrical equipment. This standard requires employees to wear arc rated (AR) clothing that meets the requirements of ASTM F1959 whenever there is a possibility of an arc flash and the employee is within the restricted approach or arc flash boundaries.
<br><br>
Prior to starting a job, employees must perform a risk assessment to determine the likelihood and severity of an arc flash occurence based on their work.
<br><br>
<h3>What are some of the specific areas covered in the NFPA 70E 2018 standard?</h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Arc Flash and Arc Blast Hazards</strong>: One of the primary focuses of NFPA 70E is addressing the dangers of arc flash and arc blast events. Arc flash refers to the release of energy caused by an electric arc, while arc blast is the resulting pressure wave. These events can cause severe injuries, including burns, hearing loss, and even fatalities.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong>: NFPA 70E emphasizes the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential electrical hazards in the workplace. This assessment helps determine the level of risk associated with various tasks and establishes appropriate safety measures.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</strong>: Proper selection and use of PPE are essential components of electrical safety. NFPA 70E outlines the requirements for PPE, including flame-resistant clothing, faceshields, gloves and other protective gear.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Training and Qualifications</strong>: NFPA 70E emphasizes the importance of training for workers involved in electrical tasks. It outlines the necessary qualifications and competencies for personnel working on or near energized equipment. Training programs based on NFPA 70E help workers understand electrical hazards, safe work practices and emergency procedures.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Safe Work Practices</strong>: The standard provides detailed guidelines for performing electrical work safely. This includes procedures for de-energizing equipment, verifying absence of voltage, and establishing an electrically safe work condition before starting work.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Maintenance of Electrical Equipment</strong>: NFPA 70E recommends regular inspection, testing, and maintenance of electrical equipment to ensure its safe operation. Proper maintenance helps identify potential issues before they escalate into hazards, minimizing the risk of electrical accidents.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Is compliance with NFPA 70E mandatory?</h3>
<br>
No. NFPA 70E serves as a national safety standard to support OSHA in developing electrical safety regulations. Federal OSHA has not incorporated it into the Code of Federal Regulations.
<br><br>
However, in the event of an injury or death due to an electrical accident, if OSHA determines that compliance with 70E would have prevented or lessened the injury, OSHA may cite the employer under the general duty clause.
<br><br>
<h3>What happens during an electrical arc flash?</h3>
<br>
An arc flash is a sudden release of electrical energy through the air when a high-voltage gap exists and there is a breakdown between conductors. It is characterized by a bright flash, intense heat, loud noise and the potential for serious injuries and damage.
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Electrical Discharge</strong>: An arc flash occurs when an electrical discharge travels through the air between conductors or from a conductor to a grounded object.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Extreme Heat</strong>: The temperatures during an arc flash can reach up to 35,000°F, which can vaporize metal and cause severe burns to anyone nearby.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Intense Light</strong>: The event produces a bright flash of light, which can cause temporary or permanent blindness if viewed directly.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Pressure Wave</strong>: The rapid expansion of air and vaporized materials generates a pressure wave, which can knock workers off their feet, damage eardrums, and create flying debris.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Molten Metal</strong>: Conductors and other metal parts in the vicinity can melt and vaporize, producing molten metal droplets that can cause additional injuries.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Sound Explosion</strong>: The arc flash is accompanied by a loud noise, often described as an explosion, which can lead to hearing damage.</li>
</ul>
