<h2 class="intro">Be prepared by following these 12 winter driving tips for winter driving preparedness during long-distance or frequent trips.</h2>

Severe winter weather and/or wintry conditions can be dangerous for workers who frequently spend their day on the road. Be prepared by following these winter driving tips for winter driving preparedness during long-distance or frequent trips.
<br><br>
Watch weather reports prior to long-distance winter driving or before driving in isolated areas. Delay trips when especially bad weather is expected. If you must leave, let other employees know your route, destination and estimated time of arrival.

<h2>Top 12 Winter Driving Tips</h2>
Here are just a few winter driving tips to help keep you and your fleet safe this winter.
<ol>
<li>
Always make sure your company or personal vehicle is in peak working order by having it regularly inspected by a mechanic.

</li>
<li>
Keep your gas tank at least half full in your vehicle at all times.

</li>
<li>
Always carry your cell phone, plus blankets, gloves, hats, food, water, ice scraper, and any needed medication in your vehicle.

</li>
<li>
When driving on icy roads, do not use cruise control or hold the brake pedal down for an extended period of time.

</li>
<li>
If you lose control of your vehicle during slippery road conditions, take your foot off the gas pedal to regain traction.Â 

</li>
<li>
Check your dome light and make sure it is not left on as this will drain your battery.

</li>
<li>
Always wear your seat belt when driving on snow-covered roads (or whenever you drive, for that matter).

</li>
<li>
If you become snow-bound, stay with your vehicle. It provides temporary shelter and makes it easier for rescuers to locate you. Don't try to walk in a severe storm: it's easy to lose sight of your vehicle in blowing snow and become lost.

</li>
<li>
Don't overexert yourself if you try to push or dig your vehicle out of the snow.

</li>
<li>
Tie a brightly colored cloth to the antenna or place a cloth at the top of a rolled-up window to signal distress.

</li>
<li>
Check your exhaust pipe to make sure it isn't clogged with snow, ice or mud. A blocked exhaust could cause deadly carbon monoxide gas to leak into the passenger compartment with the engine running.

</li>
<li>
If possible, run the engine and heater just long enough to remove the chill and to conserve gasoline.

</li>
</ol>
