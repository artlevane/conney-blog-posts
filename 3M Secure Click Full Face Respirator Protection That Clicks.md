We know you have many options when deciding on which full face respirator to choose. The 3M&trade; Secure Click&trade; Full Face Respirator is one of the latest respirators to hit the market and helps protect workers from particulates and a wide variety of gasses and vapors when used with the approved 3M&trade; Secure Click&trade; respirator kit.
<br><br>
<h2>Common 3M&trade; Secure Click&trade; Questions</h2>Let's quickly go over some common questions about the 3M Secure Click Respirator and how it relates to full face respirators in general. 
<h3>What is the difference in the way the filters and cartridges are installed in 3M&trade; Secure Click&trade; Full Facepiece Reusable Respirators FF-800 Series when compared to other 3M respirators?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Traditional 3M respirators (i.e. 3M Ultimate FX) use an "align and twist" system where the cartridge/filter is aligned with tabs on the facepiece and then turned into place. This has been the standard 3M system for many years and is still a perfectly safe and effective system for outfitting your workforce with respiratory protection.
</li>
<li>
The new 3M&trade; Secure Click&trade; connection works the same way as a seat belt. Simply align the connections on the facepiece and cartridge and/or filter and push in until you hear a click. The clicking sound helps provide workers with confidence that cartridges/filters are installed properly. To remove the cartridge/filter, simply push the release button on the facepiece. It's a quick, simple connection.
