<h2 class="intro">Thinsulate gloves have become a must-have for workers seeking supreme warmth, comfort and performance in both wet and dry conditions.</h2>
<br>
Originally made for the U.S. Army in the mid-1980s, Thinsulate&#8482; has taken the place of down feathers and other materials as a top choice for insulating winter weather gloves.
<br><br>
Thinsulate&#8482; gloves have earned a reputation among work crews for durable, dependable and comfortable warmth. Thinsulate&#8482; gloves have become a must-have for workers seeking supreme warmth, comfort and performance in both wet and dry conditions.
<br><br>
In this post we are going to learn exactly what Thinsulate&#8482; is and what you need to know when choosing a pair of Thinsulate&#8482; gloves.
<br><br>
<h2>What is Thinsulate&#8482;?</h2>
Thinsulate&#8482; is a fabric made from synthetic fibers woven together in various thicknesses to keep your hands warm at a range of temperatures.
<br><br>
Thinsulate&#8482; works by trapping more air in less space, due to its lightweight microfibers. The more air it traps, the warmer the glove will be. This explains why winter gloves that used to be big and bulky can now provide both good dexterity and surprising warmth when constructed with Thinsulate&#8482;. Thinsulate&#8482; works well with work gloves and also ski gloves.

<br><br>
<h2>How are Thinsulate&#8482; levels determined?</h2>
Determining Thinsulate&#8482; thickness levels involves measuring both the weave and weight of the fabric. Thickness is expressed as grams per square meter (GSM). Thinsulate&#8482; thickness levels range from 40 &ndash; 800 GSM.
<br><br>
The lower the GSM, the less protection the glove will give you in extreme cold conditions. A higher GSM means that the gloves will keep your hands warm in sub-zero conditions, but you may lose some dexterity because the fabric is thicker.
<br><br>
For example, 40 GSM Thinsulate&#8482; gloves are ideal for working in mild temperatures. While Thinsulate&#8482; gloves with a higher GSM will give you more thermal insulation in extreme cold conditions, they will also make your hands sweat more in mild conditions.
<br><br>
Your level of activity also affects the Thinsulate&#8482; gloves you should choose. If you&rsquo;re doing a lot of exercises or heavy work, a lower GSM may be sufficient, even in a cooler environment.
<br><br>
<h2>How does Thinsulate&#8482; work?</h2>
A unique characteristic of Thinsulate&#8482; is how it interacts with the wearer&rsquo;s body temperature and activity level. Acting like a heat reflector, Thinsulate&#8482; adjusts to body heat to deliver the right amount of insulation.
<br><br>
When working in snow, ice or rain, the fingertips of your gloves often get wet, making your hands feel even colder because the gloves never fully dry out. Cold or wet fingertips make for dangerous working conditions and put you at risk for frostbite or an on-the-job accident.
<br><br>
Thankfully, Thinsulate&#8482; gloves retain their warmth even when they get wet or you sweat.

<h2>How do I choose the correct weight for my Thinsulate&#8482; gloves?</h2>
<br>
<strong>Factors for determining which Thinsulate&#8482; gloves are best for you</strong>:
<br><br>
<ul>
    <li>the outside temperature</li>
    <li>the amount of fine or large motor skill activity</li>
    <li>the insulation in the fingertips</li>
    <li>the manufacturer of the glove</li>
    <li><strong>Mild days or work conditions</strong>: 80 &ndash; 100 GSM is perfect for the average winter day above 20&deg;F/-6&deg;C</li>
    <li><strong>Cold days and work conditions</strong>: 100 &ndash; 200 GSM will be best when temperatures fall below 20&deg;F/-6&deg;C</li>
    <li><strong>Extreme cold and arctic conditions</strong>: 200 &ndash; 800 GSM may be required for temperatures below -30&deg;F/-34&deg;C</li>
