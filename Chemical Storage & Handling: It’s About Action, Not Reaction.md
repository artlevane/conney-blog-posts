<h2 class="intro">The proper handling and storage of chemicals is critical in providing a secure and healthy working environment.</h2>
<br>
The proper handling and storage of chemicals is critical in providing health and safety in the workplace. Chemicals, especially hazardous ones, can pose serious health risks. By safely handling and storing chemicals, you minimize the chances of exposure, protecting both you and your employees from injuries, illnesses or long-term health issues.
<br><br>
<h2>Other than for personal safety, why is the safe handling and storage of chemicals so important?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Safeguarding against chemical spills and leaks is crucial for preventing pollution and ecological damage.</li>
    <li>Some specific chemicals can be corrosive and damage equipment if not stored properly. Ensuring proper storage conditions prolongs the life of equipment and prevents unexpected failures.</li>
    <li>Both OSHA and local regulations mandate safe chemical handling and storage practices. Compliance not only avoids legal consequences, but also ensures responsible and ethical business practices.</li>
    <li>Proper chemical handling and storage helps facilitate faster and more effective emergency response. Minimizing the impact of spills and providing clear information for first response allows for quick and efficient reactions.</li>
    <li>Safe chemical handling and storage practices protect not only yourself, but also your colleagues and anyone who might be affected by the chemical hazards you're working with. It's a collective responsibility to create a secure working environment.</li>

<h3>What Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should I use when handling chemicals?</h3>
When handling hazardous chemicals, the use of Personal Protective Equipment is imperative. Chemicals can pose various threats, from skin irritation to respiratory issues, and PPE acts as a barrier, preventing direct contact and inhalation.

Products you should consider wearing to minimize your risk of exposure to harmful substances include: safety glasses or goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, a lab coat or coveralls, a respirator and chemical-resistant footwear.
