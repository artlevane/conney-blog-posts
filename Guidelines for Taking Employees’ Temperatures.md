<h2 class="intro">Guidelines for Taking Employees' Temperatures</h2>
<br><br>
To help limit the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has given employers approval to take employee temperatures at work. This decision was made because the CDC and state/local health authorities have verified community spread of COVID-19. As with all medical information, data gathered (like temperatures, symptoms, etc.) must be kept confidential, as per ADA requirements.
<br>

Just as important, be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever, and some who have a fever may not have COVID-19. While the CDC recommends using a body temperature of 100.4&deg;F as the threshold point, this can be rounded down to 100&deg;F for an added measure of safety.
<br><br>

The workplace safety experts at Conney Safety recommend using a touchless thermometer (forehead/temporal artery thermometer) if possible. Make sure it was designed to take human temperatures in a healthcare setting, and is not an infrared (IR) thermometer intended for industrial applications.
<br><br>

If you must use an oral thermometer or one requiring bodily contact, <a href="https://www.conney.com/search/thermometer?utm_medium=Take-Temperature&amp;utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Conney" target="_blank">use single-use probe shields</a> to eliminate viral contamination. If probe shields are unavailable or not compatible with your thermometers, disinfect the probe thoroughly between each use.
<ul>
<li>Follow the thermometer manufacturer's disinfection directions.</li>
<li>If no disinfection guidance is given, rinse the thermometer probe in cold water. Then disinfect by wiping down the probe with rubbing alcohol or alcohol swabs. Finish with one final water rinse.</li>
</ul>
Granted, we have seen shortages on thermometers. However, Conney Safety has a variety of styles either currently in stock or soon to arrive. To best assess your needs and ensure product availability, send us an <a href="mailto:SafetySupport@conney.com">email</a> or call 800.356.9100.
<br><br>

Ultimately, a fever is only one symptom of respiratory infection (specific to COVID-19). You will also want to check employees for:
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Muscle pain</li>
<li>Fatigue or tiredness</li>
<li>New loss of smell or taste</li>
</ul>
Experts say temperature detection accuracy depends on thermometer type and the skill of the person administering the test. Below you will find a list of thermometers along with general indicator of accuracy and quality.
<br><br>

While monitoring temperatures will identify some people with COVID-19, it won't catch everyone who is currently or has been previously infected. Some of those with the illness may be asymptomatic (will never display symptoms) or pre-symptomatic (have yet to develop symptoms). This is why we still recommend the consistent use of safety measures like face masks and physical distancing to supplement your workplace temperature-monitoring efforts.
