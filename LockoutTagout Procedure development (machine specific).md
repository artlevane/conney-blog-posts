<h2 class="intro">Lockout/Tagout Procedure development (machine specific)</h2>
<br>

Accidents involving lockout violations are commonly severe and deadly, so the liability is too great to ignore.
<br>
Employee training on the Control of Hazardous Energy (Lockout/Tagout) is crucial, but a program is not complete without proper documented procedures&endash;the steps required to isolate a given energy source. Granted, not all pieces of equipment require a detailed procedure, but good documentation of all energy sources that could require maintenance will greatly reduce liability.
<br>
Conney's Safety Services team will evaluate each piece of equipment and develope additional procedures. These procedures will include photos and simple steps that keep the process easy for any employee who needs to work on the equipment. We can also assist in developing or reviewing the current written program for the organization.
