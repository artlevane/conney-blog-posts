<h2 class="intro">New Wisconsin Facemask Mandate Starts Saturday, August 1st</h2>
<br>
Everyone in an indoor or enclosed space with two or more people must wear a facemask. <a href="/pages/blog9" target="_blank">Violators face up to $200 in fines.</a>
<br><br>
<a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/07/30/file_attachments/1507337/EMO01-FaceCoverings.pdf" target="_blank"> Gov. Tony Evers issued the new statewide mandate</a> on Thursday, July 30th. The ruling applies to individuals five years and older. <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/07/30/file_attachments/1507337/EMO01-FaceCoverings.pdf" target="_blank">Some are exempt,</a> including people with specific medical conditions.

Businesses will have the right to turn away people without masks. They may also ask for details on exemption status. Facemasks are also strongly recommended, although not mandated, when outdoors and social distancing is difficult. This new mandate replaces all previous county-issued mask mandates.
<br><br>
More than 30 other states also have facemask mandates, including Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.
