Heat Stress can be dangerous for outdoor workers, especially when certain precautions are ignored. Luckily, Ergodyne Chill-Its provide an easy way to beat the heat, while staying productive. Read on to learn more about how these unique cooling products can make your work easier this summer. 
<br><br>
<h2>What is Heat Stress?</h2>
Heat stress is a set of conditions where the body and its cooling system are under stress from overheating. Heat stress occurs when the body's means of controlling its internal temperature starts to fail. High temperatures, humidity, heavy workloads, decreased air movement, lack of shading from direct heat and the type of clothing worn are all significant factors that induce heat stress.
<br><br>
Workers at greater risk of heat stress include those who are over age 65, are overweight, have heart disease or high blood pressure, or take medications that may be affected by extreme heat.
<br><br>
Washington, Minnesota, and California have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure. Federal OSHA has a General Duty Clause that requires employers to provide a place of employment that is "free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees."

<h2>Symptoms of Heat Stress Disorders</h2>
<ul><li>Heat Cramps - Symptoms are painful spasms of the muscles. Heat cramps are caused when workers consume large quantities of water but fail to take in enough salt to replace the salt their body lost through sweating. Tired muscles are most susceptible to cramping.</li><li>Heat Exhaustion - Symptoms for this disorder are moist, clammy, pale skin; profuse sweating; extreme weakness or fatigue; dry mouth; dizziness; fast pulse; rapid breathing; muscle cramps and nausea.</li><li>Heat/Sun Stroke - Symptoms are a very high body temperature (104&deg;F or higher); lack of sweat; mental confusion, delirium, or hallucinations; deep breathing and rapid pulse; hot, dry, red or mottled skin; and dilated pupils. Seek medical help at once for this condition.</li></ul>

<br><br>
Heat stress disorders are serious. Humans have an ingenious system for regulating body temperature-a personal, "natural" air conditioner. We sweat, it evaporates through our skin, and we're cooled off. But this personal air conditioner can fail, and often does if we overexert when environmental temperatures are high.
<br><br>
