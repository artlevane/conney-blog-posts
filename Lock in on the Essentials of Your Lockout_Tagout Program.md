Lockout/tagout procedures are essential for ensuring the safety of employees during the servicing and maintenance of machines and equipment. Locking out and tagging equipment prevents the unexpected release of hazardous energy, which could lead to injuries or fatalities. By selecting the correct [lockout/tagout products](https://www.conney.com/category/facilities-safety-lockout-tagout?utm_medium=lockout-tagout-program&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney) for the job, you can protect workers by controlling hazardous energy.<br><br>

This article provides a complete overview of the various types of lockout/tagout products you may need in your facility.<br>

## Why Use Lockout/Tagout?

Lockout Tagout (LOTO) is a crucial safety procedure designed to protect workers from hazardous energy sources during the maintenance and servicing of equipment. The primary risk that LOTO addresses is unexpected startup or release of stored energy, which can cause severe injuries or fatalities.<br><br>

Machines often store energy in various forms, such as electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical, which, if released unintentionally, can lead to crushing, electrocution, burns, or amputation. LOTO ensures that machinery is completely de-energized and cannot be accidentally activated while workers are servicing it. By physically locking the equipment’s power sources and attaching warning tags, the procedure safeguards employees against the dangers of accidental machine operation.<br><br>

Without proper LOTO procedures (or some kind of energy control program), workers face significant risk of injury from machinery restarting while in the middle of a repair. Implementing Lockout/Tagout helps eliminate these hazards by ensuring that only authorized employees control the restoration of energy and equipment reactivation. <br><br>

## Does OSHA have a Standard for LOTO?

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates strict guidelines for LOTO under Standard 29 CFR 1910.147, aimed at controlling hazardous energy during service and maintenance of machines and equipment. OSHA emphasizes that LOTO procedures must be implemented to prevent unexpected energization, startup of machinery, or the release of residual energy, which could result in harm to workers.<br><br>

The standard requires employers to develop, implement, and enforce an energy control program that includes documented procedures, employee training, and periodic inspections. Furthermore, appropriate lockout or tagout devices must be used for energy isolation and be durable, standardized, and substantial to prevent removal without the use of excessive force or unusual techniques. <br><br>

This comprehensive approach ensures worker safety and compliance with legal requirements, reducing the risk of accidents with potentially affected employees and injuries in workplaces.<br>

## What are the kinds of Lockout/Tagout Products Available?

There are a number of products that are common in the lockout/tagout category. We carry a large range of products that can assist your facility with their LOTO program.<br>

### Padlocks

Padlocks are by far the most common lockout/tagout devices. They are typically used to secure energy-isolating devices in a locked position.

* Keyed-Different Padlocks have a unique key that cannot open any other lock, making them ideal for individual worker safety.  
* Keyed-Alike Padlocks can be opened with the same key. These are useful when a single worker needs to secure multiple points simultaneously.  
* Master Keyed Padlocks allow a supervisor or safety officer to open multiple locks with a master key, even when individual keys are different.

When choosing a padlock consider that steel padlocks are more durable and resistant to physical tampering. While plastic or composite padlocks may be better suited for electrical applications because they prevent the conduction of electricity.<br>

### Lockout Hasps

Lockout Hasps allow multiple workers (usually six or more) to apply their padlocks to a single energy isolation point. Each worker places their lock on the hasp, ensuring that the equipment cannot be re-energized until all workers have removed their locks.

* Standard Hasps typically consist of a metal or heavy-duty plastic shackle that can be inserted into a locking point, such as a circuit breaker, valve handle or switch.  
* Scissors Hasps have two interlocking arms that open and close like a pair of scissors. The arms have a series of holes along their length, which are used for attaching padlocks. When the hasp is closed, the arms overlap, and the holes align, allowing padlocks to be inserted to lock the device in place.<br>

### Valve Lockouts

Valve Lockouts are designed to fit different types of valves and ensure that they cannot be operated until the lockout is removed. They secure valves in a safe position, preventing the release of hazardous liquids, gases or steam.

* Ball Valve Lockouts clamp onto the handle of a ball valve to prevent it from being turned.  
* Gate Valve Lockouts encapsulate the valve handle, preventing it from being operated.  
* Butterfly Valve Lockouts secure butterfly valve handles in the off position.  
* Plug Valve Lockouts prevent access to the handle of plug valves.<br>

### Circuit Breaker Lockouts

Circuit Breaker Lockouts are designed to secure circuit breakers in the off position, preventing accidental re-energization of electrical circuits.

* Universal Circuit Breaker Lockouts universal circuit breaker lockouts are designed to fit a wide range of circuit breaker models and sizes. These lockouts are compatible with various types of circuit breakers, including single-pole, double-pole and even some three-pole breakers.  
* Single-Pole Lockouts are designed specifically for single-pole circuit breakers, which are commonly found in residential and commercial electrical panels.  
* Multi-Pole Lockouts are used to lock out multiple circuit breakers simultaneously. Circuits may involve multiple poles, a multi-pole lockout ensures that all these poles are securely isolated.<br>

### Electrical Lockouts

* Electrical Lockouts are specifically designed for isolating electrical energy sources beyond just circuit breakers.  
* Plug Lockouts are used to lock out power plugs, preventing them from being connected to an outlet.  
  * Pin-In Lockouts fit over the prongs (pins) of a plug when it is unplugged. The device covers the prongs and prevents them from being inserted back into an outlet.  
  * Pin-Out Lockouts lock out the socket or outlet itself, preventing any plug from being inserted.  
* Switch Lockouts are used to lock switches in the "off" position, preventing the switch from being flipped.  
* Electrical Panel Lockouts secure entire electrical panels to prevent unauthorized access.<br>

### Cable Lockouts

Cable Lockouts consist of a long, flexible cable that can be threaded through multiple lockout points. The cable is typically made of steel and coated with a durable plastic or vinyl to resist cutting and wear. Cable lockouts can secure multiple energy isolation points or devices that are not easily locked out with other lockout/tagout products.

* Standard Cable Lockouts use a steel cable coated in plastic, with an adjustable locking mechanism.  
* Retractable Cable Lockouts features a retractable cable for easy storage and deployment.<br>

### Lockout Stations and Kits

Lockout Stations and Kits provide organized storage for lockout/tagout devices, ensuring that they are readily available when needed.

* Wall-Mounted Lockout Stations are fixed to walls and often include shelves, hooks, and slots for organizing lockout devices and accessories.  
* Portable Lockout Kits are compact kits that can be carried to different locations within your facility.  
* Group Lock Boxes are used for group lockout situations, where multiple workers lock out a single device, rather than directly on the energy isolation points themselves. This system ensures that equipment cannot be re-energized until every worker has removed their personal lock from the box.<br>

### Pneumatic Lockouts

Pneumatic lockouts are used to secure pneumatic energy sources, such as air hoses and air-operated valves.

* Pneumatic Valve Lockouts secure the handles or levers of pneumatic valves, such as ball valves or gate valves, which control the flow of compressed air or gas.  
* Pneumatic Plug Lockouts cover the end of pneumatic plugs and fittings to prevent them from being connected or disconnected.  
* Air Line Lockouts are used to isolate sections of pneumatic tubing or hoses to prevent the flow of compressed air through specific lines.  
* Regulator Lockouts are used to secure the adjustment knobs or handles of pressure regulators.<br>

### Gas Cylinder Lockouts

Gas cylinder lockouts are safety devices used to secure gas cylinders and prevent the accidental or unauthorized release of hazardous gases during maintenance, repair or storage.

* Cylinder Valve Lockouts cover or encase the valve handle of a gas cylinder, preventing it from being opened. The lockout is placed over the valve handle and secured with a padlock.  
* Cylinder Cap Lockouts are used to secure the protective caps on gas cylinders. They ensure that the cap, which protects the valve, remains in place.  
* Regulator Lockouts are used to secure the adjustment controls on gas regulators.<br>

### Tags

Tags are used in conjunction with lockout devices to provide information about the lockout situation, such as the person responsible, the reason for the lockout, and the date.

* Standard Lockout/Tagout Tags typically include fields for the name, date, and reason for the lockout.  
* Custom Tags can be designed with specific information or warnings pertinent to your facility's operations.

Tags are typically constructed of plastic/PVC because plastic is durable and resistant to harsh environments, including chemicals and extreme temperatures. However, economical paper or cardboard tags can be used in less harsh environments.<br>
