Why do we recommo Site Safety Audit?

Even the most experienced safety manager will benefit from having another set of eyes to assess the status of their current safety programs. This service can also provide newer safety managers with a priority list on where to begin.
<br>
Our Certified Safety Professionals will tailor a site walk-through based on the needs and expectations of your facility. We can customize facility audits to focus on specific issues (i.e., hand protection) as well as interview employees to gather valuable feedback. We'll also provide a detailed report documenting the activity of the auditor.

Facility/department safety audits are dependent on the following:
<br>
What is the size of facility?

Is it a comprehensive vs. topic specific audit?

How much time is allowed to tour the facility?

What are the expectations of the written report?
