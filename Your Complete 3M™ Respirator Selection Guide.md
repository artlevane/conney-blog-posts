<h2 class="intro">Our 3M&#8482; Respirator Selection Guide is a valuable tool for organizations looking to choose the right respirator for their workplace applications.</h2>
<br>
This 3M&#8482; Respirator Selection Guide will help you select the appropriate respiratory protection based on your specific needs and the hazards present in your workplace. It includes information on various types of respirators offered by 3M, such as disposable respirators, half-mask respirators, full facepiece respirators, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) and supplied air respirators.
<br><br>
Additionally, this 3M&#8482; Respirator Selection Guide offers guidance on factors to consider when selecting a respirator, including fit, comfort, durability, and compatibility with other personal protective equipment.
<br><br>
<h2>Know Your Assigned Protection Factors (APF)</h2>
<br>
Respirators are rated for the level of protection they provide to the person wearing them. These ratings are called Assigned Protection Factors (APF). The APF represents the protection multiplied by the Permissible Exposure Level (PEL) set by OSHA. Below we've outlined general guidelines for the APFs of different types of 3M&#8482; respirators:

<br><br>
A disposable 3M&#8482; respirator is designed for single-use applications. Disposable respirators typically consist of a filtering facepiece, which covers the nose and mouth and often incorporates one or more filtering layers to remove airborne particles.

<br><br>
A half-mask 3M&#8482; respirator covers the nose and mouth, providing filtration and protection against airborne contaminants. As the name suggests, it only covers half of the wearer's face, typically from the bridge of the nose down to the chin. It's usually made of materials such as silicone or thermoplastic elastomer to provide a comfortable and secure fit.

<br><br>
A full facepiece 3M&#8482; respirator covers the entire face, providing both respiratory and eye protection against airborne contaminants. Unlike half-mask respirators, which only cover the nose and mouth, full facepiece respirators offer a more comprehensive level of protection by also covering the eyes and providing a tight seal around the entire face. The facepiece of a full facepiece respirator is a large, clear visor that covers the entire face, including the eyes, nose, and mouth.

<br><br>
A 3M&#8482; Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR) uses a battery-powered blower to provide a flow of filtered air to the wearer. Unlike traditional respirators that rely solely on the user's breathing to draw air through filter cartridges, a PAPR actively delivers filtered air to the user, creating positive pressure inside the facepiece A PAPR typically includes a facepiece or hood, a blower unit, a hose or tubing, filters, and a rechargeable battery.

<br><br>
A 3M&#8482; Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) provides breathable air to the wearer in environments where the ambient air is unsafe to breathe due to contaminants and/or lack of oxygen. SCBAs are commonly used by firefighters, rescue workers and industrial workers in hazardous environments. The main components of a typical SCBA are the facepiece, oxygen cylinder, pressure regulator and harness (sometimes with escape mechanism). SCBAs are designed to provide a reliable source of breathable air for a limited duration, typically ranging from 30 minutes to 1 hour.

<br><br>
A 3M&#8482; Emergency Escape Breathing Device (EEBD) provides a portable and self-contained source of breathable air for emergency use in hazardous environments. EEBDs are typically used in situations where the primary means of respiratory protection, such as SCBAs, may not be easily available or accessible, or when a quick escape from a hazardous atmosphere is necessary. They offer a compact and lightweight design and a smaller cylinder of compressed air that would typically last from 10 to 30 minutes.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Remember, these APFs are based on the assumption that your respirator fits properly and has no air leaks in or around the seal to the face. And unless you do fit testing, you won't know if the respirator is properly sealing to your face. Our Safety Support Team is available to assist you with fit testing and provide the information you need on respirator usage.

<h2>Select Your 3M&#8482; Respirator in Four Simple Steps</h2>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify the Contaminants You're Dealing With</strong> &ndash; The primary source of information on a chemical's state and physical form is the Safety Data Sheet (SDS). The SDS may also make recommendations for what type of 3M&#8482; respirator may be needed to work safely with the product. Once the potential contaminants are identified, air sampling should be done to determine how much of the contaminant is likely to be present in a work shift.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>Test Your Environment</strong> &ndash; Air sampling can be performed by a consulting firm, through an OSHA consultation, or even by yourself. We encourage you to contact Our Safety Support Team to determine the best option for you. This evaluation should include a reasonable estimate of employee exposure to respiratory hazards and an identification of the contaminant's chemical state and physical form.
    </li>
    <br>
    Once the contaminant level is established, you should investigate effective hazard control methods, such as engineering and administrative controls, before resorting to a respirator. If you do need a 3M&#8482; respirator, our trained staff can help you make the appropriate choice.
    <br><br>
    <li>
        <strong>Choose a Level of Protection</strong> &ndash; Select a filter that is designed to remove airborne particulates which may be harmful to the lungs in your workplace. Particulates which may be blocked by a filter include dust, fumes (metal particles from welding), fibers, and mists.
    </li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Dry particulates can be removed with an N95, N99 or N100 filter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dry or oily particulates can be removed with an R95, R99, P95, P99, or P100 filter.
            <ul>
                <li>N refers to no oil</li>
                <li>R refers to oil resistant</li>
                <li>P stands for oil proof</li>
                <li>The number after these letters has to do with the efficiency of 95, 99 or 100</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You may even need a cartridge and a filter, depending on the nature of your work. Cartridges contain either activated charcoal or other sorbent media which can be chemically treated to remove various gases and vapors. We have several types of cartridges to choose from. Certain chemicals will not be blocked by the cartridges, and you may need to consider a supplied air system.
    <br><br>
    <li>
        <strong>Size Your Respirator</strong> &ndash; A mask must fit properly and be fit tested to ensure complete protection. It should have a tight seal around the nose and mouth to prevent leakage. Our Safety Support Team offers fit testing services to help assist you with this process. Remember that all persons who wear 3M&#8482; respirators for a chemical hazard must conform to OSHA requirements, which includes fit testing and medical evaluations.
    </li>
