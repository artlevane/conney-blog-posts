[Coated gloves](https://www.conney.com/category/hand-protection-copy-coated-gloves?utm_medium=coated-gloves&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney-Coated) are work gloves that feature a coating applied to the palm, fingers or both, providing additional protection, grip and durability.

Among the most commonly used coated gloves are nitrile, latex, polyurethane, PVC and rubber. Each of these glove types offers distinct features, strengths and limitations. Understanding the differences is essential in choosing the right gloves for your specific applications.

<br><br>

## Nitrile Coated Gloves

Nitrile coated gloves are made from a synthetic rubber compound. They are highly resistant to oils, chemicals, and punctures, making them ideal for industrial and medical use.

* Nitrile coated gloves off superior chemical resistance against solvents, oils and many chemicals compared to other coatings.  
* Nitrile is highly resistant to abrasions and tears, offering extended longevity in tough environments.  
* Unlike latex, nitrile coated gloves are synthetic, making them a safe alternative for individuals with latex allergies.  
* Though they offer protection, nitrile coated gloves can be stiffer, slightly reducing tactile sensitivity and flexibility.  
* Common uses: Industries requiring chemical handling, such as laboratories, automotive work and manufacturing.

## Latex Coated Gloves

Latex is a natural rubber product known for its elasticity, flexibility, and snug fit. These gloves are popular in both medical and industrial settings due to their tactile sensitivity and comfort.

* Latex gloves offer the best fit and feel, making them ideal for tasks requiring precision.  
* Latex coated gloves provide an excellent grip, even in wet or oily conditions.  
* While latex offers good resistance to water and some chemicals, it is less effective against oils and solvents compared to nitrile or PVC gloves.  
* Some people are allergic to natural latex proteins, which can cause skin irritation or more severe reactions.  
* Common uses: Healthcare, food handling and industries requiring high dexterity tasks.

## Polyurethane (PU) Coated Gloves

Polyurethane is a polymer that offers a lightweight and breathable coating. Polyurethane coated gloves are often chosen for their excellent tactile sensitivity.

* These gloves provide excellent flexibility and tactile feedback, making them great for delicate tasks.  
* Polyurethane is thinner and more breathable than nitrile or latex, which can reduce hand fatigue.  
* PU gloves are durable in dry or lightly oily environments, providing good protection without sacrificing grip.  
* Polyurethane does not offer as much chemical or cut resistance as nitrile or latex gloves.  
* Though resistant to abrasion, PU coatings can wear down faster in more rugged environments.  
* Common uses: Electronics assembly, precision work and light-duty tasks in clean environments.

## PVC Coated Gloves

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a synthetic plastic polymer known for its resistance to chemicals, oils, and water. PVC coated gloves provide a durable barrier in harsh conditions.

* PVC gloves are highly resistant to a variety of chemicals, oils, greases, and solvents, making them ideal for chemical handling.  
* PVC is tough and can withstand abrasion and punctures better than many other materials.  
* PVC is not as breathable, which can cause discomfort during prolonged use.  
* PVC gloves tend to be less flexible and can feel bulky, limiting dexterity.  
* Common uses: Chemical processing, petrochemical industries, and tasks involving oil, grease, or wet environments.

## Rubber Coated Gloves

Made of natural or synthetic rubber, these gloves provide a durable and flexible coating. They offer protection in a wide range of applications.

* Rubber coated gloves offer good stretchability and a balance between flexibility and protection.  
* Rubber provides excellent grip, especially in wet or oily conditions.  
* While not as chemically resistant as nitrile, rubber offers moderate protection against certain chemicals and physical hazards.  
* Though they offer some protection, rubber gloves do not resist solvents and oils as well as nitrile or PVC coated gloves.  
* Similar to latex, natural rubber can cause allergic reactions in some users.  
* Common uses: Construction, agriculture and general handling tasks where grip and flexibility are essential.

## What level of coating should I choose?

Coated gloves come with three levels of coating, each offering varying degrees of coverage and protection. Choose the appropriate balance of protection, dexterity, and comfort based on your specific work requirements.

* Finger coating is applied to the fingers only. The minimal coating allows for greater flexibility and tactile sensitivity, making them ideal for tasks that require precise finger movements.  
* Palm coating is applied only to the palm area to provide grip and protection while maintaining flexibility in the fingers. This allows for breathability on the back of the hand, reducing sweating and discomfort.  
* Full coating covers the entire glove providing maximum protection against liquids, chemicals and abrasions. This coating offers complete coverage for environments where the hand may be exposed to hazardous substances or harsh conditions.

## Should I choose a breathable knit shell or an enhanced cut-resistant shell?

### Breathable Knit Shells

* Knit shells are typically made from materials like polyester, cotton, or nylon to provide lightweight, flexible, and breathable protection.  
* The breathable nature of the knit shell allows for greater airflow, reducing heat buildup and keeping hands dry and comfortable.  
* Knit shell gloves are generally more flexible, allowing for better dexterity and freedom of movement.  
* Knit shell gloves are typically lighter and less bulky, making them ideal for tasks that require fine motor skills or precision.  
* While knit shells offer some protection from minor abrasions or scrapes, they are not designed for tasks involving sharp objects or heavy handling.  
* Common uses: Light-duty tasks such as packaging, warehouse work and general assembly.

### Enhanced Cut-Resistant Shell

* Made from advanced materials such as Kevlar, Dyneema, or steel fibers, an enhanced cut-resistant shell is designed to provide superior protection from cuts, punctures and abrasions.  
* The enhanced cut-resistant shell is designed to protect against sharp edges, making it ideal for industries where workers handle sharp tools, blades or glass.  
* These gloves are designed to withstand heavy-duty use, making them longer lasting in demanding environments.  
* [Cut-resistant gloves](https://www.conney.com/category/hand-protection-copy-cut-resistant-gloves?BRAND=superior-glove&PMSORT=FEATURED&PMFILT=shop_by_brand#page_no=1*&utm_medium=coated-gloves&utm_source=Blog&utm_campaign=Conney-Cut-Resistant) often meet or exceed ANSI and/or EN388 cut resistance standards.  
* While some cut-resistant shells incorporate breathable elements, they are generally less breathable than knit shells, leading to potential discomfort or sweating in hot environments.  
* Due to the thicker, more robust materials, these gloves may be stiffer and less flexible, reducing tactile sensitivity.  
* Common uses: High-risk tasks in industries such as glass handling, construction, metalworking and manufacturing.
