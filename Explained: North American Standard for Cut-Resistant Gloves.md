<h2>Explained: North American Standard for Cut-Resistant Gloves</h2>
<br>
Whether you need gloves for home improvement, meat cutting, wood carving, or for working with any kind of sharp materials, hand protection is of the utmost importance. It can be a daunting task selecting the proper safety work gloves that are cut-proof among all the gloves offered. Luckily, there are performance standards that grade the effectiveness of each glove, so you can make a better-informed decision when selecting your protection.
<br><br>
Globally, there are two different performance standards for cut resistance. The European standard (EN388:2016) is used in Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, Mexico and even parts of Canada and the United States. The ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 is the US standard for glove testing but is also used in other parts of North America as well.
<br><br>
These standards are not identical and do not correlate, which can cause confusion when you’re trying to select the right Bob Dale Gloves Cut-Resistant Gloves for your specific tasks.
<br><br>
The purpose of this blog is to explain the ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 cut standard (the primary standard used in the United States), as well as its testing methodology. The goal is to help you set your expectations for performance and cut resistance when choosing Bob Dale Gloves Cut-Resistant Gloves for your workplace.

<h2>What is the ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 standard for cut-resistant gloves?</h2>
<br>
The cut resistance standard from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) became effective in March of 2016. It is the standard for testing cut-resistant gloves in the United States but is also used in parts of Canada and Mexico as well. This standard measures cut resistance for industrial work gloves on a 9-level scale from A1 through A9. The previous standard used a 5-level scale (where grade level 5 protection was considered best), so the current standard allows for much greater accuracy.
<br><br>
<h3>What does the ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 cut standard entail?</h3>
<br>
This standard uses a Tomodynamometer (TDM-100) machine to measure the amount of weight (grams) necessary for a blade to cut through the material. Increasing weights are added to achieve cut-through on the glove material. The blade is replaced after each cut and weight (grams) is added until cut-through is obtained. 
<br><br>
Multiple tests are conducted and the average is recorded to give the final gram rating (ranging from 200 to 6000 grams). These results are represented by levels A1 to A9, with the greater number being the higher the level of cut resistance.
<br><br>
<h2>What level of Bob Dale Gloves Cut-Resistant Gloves do I need for my specific application?</h2>
<br>
We’ve compiled an example list of common workplace applications and grouped them according to the approximate level of cut protection required. Please note that this is only a general guide, as every job has many variables that might call for either greater or less protection.
<ul>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A1</strong>: material handling, small parts assembly with sharp edges, packaging, warehouse, general-purpose, forestry, construction</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A2</strong>: material handling, small parts assembly with sharp edges, packaging, warehouse, general-purpose, forestry, construction, pulp & paper, automotive assembly</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A3</strong>: material handling, small parts assembly with sharp edges, packaging, warehouse, general-purpose, forestry, construction, pulp & paper, automotive assembly</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A4</strong>: appliance manufacturing, bottle and light glass handling, canning, drywalling, electrical, carpet installation, HVAC, pulp and paper, automotive assembly, metal fabrication, metal handling, packaging, warehouse, aerospace industry, food prep/processing</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A5</strong>: appliance manufacturing, bottle and light glass handling, canning, drywalling, electrical, carpet installation, HVAC, pulp and paper, automotive assembly, metal fabrication, metal handling, packaging, warehouse, aerospace industry, food prep/processing</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A6</strong>: metal stamping, metal recycling, pulp and paper (changing slitter blades), automotive assembly, metal fabrication, sharp metal stampings, glass manufacturing, window manufacturing, recycling plant/sorting, HVAC, food prep/processing, meat processing, aerospace industry</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A7</strong>: metal stamping, metal recycling, pulp and paper (changing slitter blades), automotive assembly, metal fabrication, sharp metal stampings, glass manufacturing, window manufacturing, recycling plant/sorting, HVAC, food prep/processing, meat processing, aerospace industry</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A8</strong>: metal stamping, metal recycling, pulp and paper (changing slitter blades), automotive assembly, metal fabrication, sharp metal stampings, glass manufacturing, window manufacturing, recycling plant/sorting, HVAC, food prep/processing, meat processing, aerospace industry</li>
    <li><strong>ANSI Cut Level A9</strong>: metal stamping, metal recycling, pulp and paper (changing slitter blades), automotive assembly, metal fabrication, sharp metal stampings, glass manufacturing, window manufacturing, recycling plant/sorting, HVAC, food prep/processing, meat processing, aerospace industry</li>
    <li>The A1-A9 job tasks/application examples listed above are for general purposes only. All specific cut and industry job tasks should be evaluated to determine the appropriate ANSI cut protection glove required for the specific task.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>What exactly is a Tomodynamometer?</h3>
A Tomodynamometer (TDM-100) cut test machine is designed to measure the cut resistance of materials without the influence of sample thickness or direction of blade motion. The tester consists of a straight blade which is drawn across the sample mounted on a curved surface. The cut resistance measuring device operates on the principle of applying varying loads to a straight-edged blade and recording the distance required to cut through the sample. The testing result is calculated of a cutting load at a specified reference distance using a regression procedure.

<h3>What are the direct and indirect costs associated with a workplace hand injury for the employer?</h3>
<br>
Every year, hand injuries result in more than a million emergency room visits, making them the second-most common work-related injury, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The most important reason to reduce these numbers is worker health and safety. But a compelling business case for accident prevention exists, too. The direct costs of hand injuries are very high, but the indirect costs – such as lost productivity, training for replacement workers, and even negative publicity – are even higher.
<br><br>
Here are some sobering statistics from a study appearing in Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery:
<ul>
    <li>Stitches can cost up to $2,000, mending a laceration can cost up to $10,000, and repairing a severed tendon can easily exceed $10,000</li>
    <li>The BLS reports the average hand injury claim has now exceeded $6,000, with each lost-time workers’ compensation claim reaching $7,500</li>
</ul>
These are only the tip of the iceberg. According to the American Society of Safety Engineers, indirect costs of injuries can be up to 20x the direct costs. Other indirect, virtually incalculable costs can include the expense of investigating the accident, lost worker productivity, damage to workers’ morale that leads to absenteeism, and a negative impact on the company’s reputation.
<br>
<h3>What is High-Performance Polyethylene (HPPE)?</h3>
<br>
HPPE fiber (sometimes referred to by the brand names Dyneema and Spectra) has an ultra-high strength-to-weight ratio, so it’s not only flexible and lightweight but also highly durable. Pound-for-pound, HPPE is up to 15x stronger than steel, providing excellent protection from both abrasion injuries and cut injuries. Many styles of Bob Dale Cut-Resistant Gloves are made with HPPE because it offers an ideal combination of:
<ul>
    <li>Durability</li>
    <li>Abrasion resistance</li>
    <li>Energy absorption</li>
    <li>Flexibility</li>
    <li>Longevity</li>
    <li>Resistance to chemicals, moisture, and UV radiation</li>
</ul>
