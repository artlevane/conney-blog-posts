<h2 class="intro">Respirable crystalline silica training</h2>
<br>

OSHA has issued a standard (29 CFR 1926.1153) that requires Construction employers to limit worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica and to take other steps to protect workers. This standard requires engineering controls (such as water spray to control the dust, ventilation systems, or even vacuums) to help limit the exposure to this dangerous dust. If these engineering systems cannot adequately control the dust, then respirators will need to be provided. Some sites will be required to use air monitoring to determine employee exposures (if work activities do not cleanly fit into Table 1 of the standard).
<br>
On top of this, OSHA 1910.1053 is the newer standard for addressing respirable crystalline silica in General Industry. While exposure limits are the same, workplace control measures can be more challenging in a "non-construction" environment.
<br>
Every employer has a unique challenge when it comes to the respirable silica standard. Our customized training will address your specific work environment, giving the employees appropriate options to keep them safe when exposed to this dangerous substance. Employees will benefit by best understanding why this standard is so important to their health now and in the future.
<br>
Our customized Respirable Crystalline Silica Trainings will teach employees:
