<h2 class="intro">90% of workplace injuries are preventable if the user had been wearing protective safety glasses.</h2>
<h1 style="padding-left: 120px;"></h1>
<br><br>
Every year, an estimated 20,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) resulting in more than $300 million a year in lost production time, medical expenses and worker's compensation costs.
<br><br>
<h2>Are Safety Glasses Necessary?</h2>
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has established a standard for using, testing, marking, choosing, and maintaining eye protection. They have identified three main categories of eye protection: impact vs. non-impact, splash and dust protection, and optical radiation protection. All three are important to some extent in any specific job where hazardous substances or materials may be present. With all that said, OSHA does not require ANSI compliance for eye protection, so awareness of this standard is important.
<br><br>
<h3>Eye Injuries Are Typically the Result of Not Wearing Safety Glasses or Goggles</h3>

</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>The Three Most Common Types of Workplace Eye Injuries</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Striking or scraping: The majority of eye injuries result from small particles or objects striking or scraping the eye, such as: dust, cement chips, metal slivers and wood chips. These materials are often ejected by tools, windblown or fall from above a worker. Large objects may also strike the eye or face, or a worker may run into an object causing blunt-force trauma to the eyeball or eye socket.
</li>
<li>
Penetration: Objects like nails, staples or slivers of wood or metal can go through the eyeball and result in a permanent loss of vision.
</li>
<li>
Chemical and thermal burns: Industrial chemicals or cleaning products are common causes of chemical burns to one or both eyes. Thermal burns to the eye also occur, often among welders. These burns routinely damage workers' eyes and surrounding tissue.
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Choosing the Best Style of Safety Glasses</h2>

<br><br>
<h3>How Polarized Lenses Work</h3>
Polarized lenses are coated with tiny vertical stripes that only allow vertically angled light to enter the wearer's eyes. Glare is eliminated because the horizontal light waves cannot bypass the vertical filter.
<br><br>
As a result of this filtering, the image you see with polarized lenses is a bit darker than usual. But objects look crisper and clearer with polarized lenses, and details are easier to see.
<br><br>
People who wear polarized sunglasses typically report their eyes are less tired than usual after hours in the sun. Polarized sunglasses are an ideal choice for many outdoor jobs, specifically jobs that involve long days working near water or snow, because the lenses drastically reduce the amount of glare that reaches the eye.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that most sunglasses labeled as blocking ultraviolet (UV) rays, may not be polarized. Polarized lenses will always be labeled as such. If a pair of sunglasses is not specifically labeled as polarized, they probably aren't.
