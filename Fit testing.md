<h2 class="intro">Fit testing</h2>
<br>

OSHA's Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134) requires that employees be both medically cleared through a medical evaluation and fit tested before wearing a respirator, as well as on an annual basis. If respirators are not required (due to air testing results) but you require an employee to wear a respirator, then fit testing must also be completed.

In addition, fit tests should be performed whenever a different size, style, model, or make of respirator is used or when any facial changes occur that could affect fit, such as significant weight fluctuation or dental work.

Conney Safety provides Qualitative and Quantitative Fit Testing Services that will help ensure your facility meets these requirements.
