<h3>Welding Gloves</h3>
<img class="special-img" src="/websphere/blog/assets/images/welding-gloves.webp">
<br>
Welding gloves protect the welder's hands from the various hazards associated with welding, including extreme heat, sparks, molten metal and electrical shock. Choose a welding glove based on the type of welding you're doing.
<ul>
    <li>MIG Welding Gloves provide maximum heat protection and are a good general purpose welding glove. Because of the higher level of protection, you do sacrifice some flexibility with MIG gloves. MIG welding gloves are typically made of cowhide, pigskin or deerskin.</li>
    <li>TIG Welding Gloves are made of much thinner, softer leathers. They provide adequate protection, but increased finger sensitivity and dexterity. They do provide reduced heat protection, when compared to MIG welding gloves. The gloves fit snugly to allow for more precise manipulation of your torch. MIG welding gloves are typically made of cowhide, pigskin or goatskin.</li>
    <li>Stick Welding Gloves are constructed of thicker cuts of leather. The straightforward stick welding process means that you won't need a very flexible glove. Stick welding gloves are typically made of elkskin, cowhide, goatskin or pigskin.</li>
    <li>Welding Mittens are for jobs where protection is your main priority and dexterity is not a concern. Mittens typically don't provide sufficient dexterity to control welding equipment. We offer welding mittens made of cowhide.</li>
